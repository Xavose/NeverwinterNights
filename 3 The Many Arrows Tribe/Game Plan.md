# Traveling to the Arrow Head

The desitnation to the Arrow Head is two days travel by caravan. During the travels, the party is welcome to speak with the orcs or act amongst themselves. 

On the dawn of the second day, the caravan is attacked by a mob of trolls lead by an Ice Troll. 

The Ice Trolls focus on killing orcs (for whom they have aquired a delicious taste).
