# Traveling to the Arrow Head

The desitnation to the Arrow Head is two days travel by caravan. During the travels, the party is welcome to speak with the orcs or act amongst themselves.

On the dawn of the second day, the caravan is attacked by a mob of trolls lead by an Ice Troll.

The Ice Trolls focus on killing orcs (for whom they have aquired a delicious taste).

# Arival at the Arrow Head Tribe

King Obould's decision to enlist the help of the City of Neverwinter was not a popular one. In Yurick's absence, the council of elder's have dethrowned King Obould and labeled him, the traitor king. Aware of Yurick's impending arrival, the council muster's all of the orc warriors at it's gates to take the player's hostage. They are especially interested in capturing and enslaving Dalen, for being a member of the Uthgart tribes. 

Once the players are either captured or evade capture they must decide what best to do next. 

## In case of capture

- One by one the character's are brought before the orc horde to be shown their weakness through torture, and for interrogation.
  - Character's will make performanve or Con saves to withstand the torture. On a failure, they have to give up a key piece of information about the city of neverwinter. On a success, they manage to impress the onlooking crowed with their endurance.
- One by one, the character's are brought out to fight an orc with their bare hands. If they succeed, the crowed is turned in their favor. If they fail, they gain one level of exhaustion.
  - Dalen has to fight a troll
- Yurick finds them and helps them to plan an escape
  - Will drug the guards and slips them a piece of soap stone and wood that they might be able to carve a key out of.
  - Once the player's are free they can find their gear (or what's left of it) in the clan treasure hall.
