The heroes of Neverwinter chose death over surrender when faced with Car'Trok the Disenter. Without their help, King Obould was executed along with all of his decendents. Car'Trok has raised a new orc regime bent on the death and destruction of all lesser races. 

The final battle between the adventurers and the Orcs served as a launching point for Car'Trok's future campaign. And the orc horde is now more than willing to fight the city of Neverwinter to the death. In the coming months, the roads in and out of Neverwinter will become more and more dangerous as orc raid parties become far too frequent. 

With the combined might of the orc clans, Car'Trok begins to recruit the goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear tribes under his command as well. The entire party has taken up hold within Cragwam castler to the South East of Neverwitner. Their, they bide their time and acrew more power until they feel prepared to take on the city as a whole. 


Unkown to all, the entire coup was orchestrated by Fenthic Moss and the traitor preists and paladins of Tyr in service to their lord and masters the creator race.
