Tiear'tierren, priestess of Lolth leads her house towards this last ditch effort of revenge. Tiear's mother and three sisters were murdered by the clan battlehammer in the dwarven takeover of Gauntlgrym. She pursue's Bruenor's death above all else.

She views the player's as pests and is unwilling to lower herself to battleing them head on (in truth, she fears that doing so would diminish her already strenous link with Lolth). She instead chooses to array her forces against the party as best she can while still pursuing her goal.
