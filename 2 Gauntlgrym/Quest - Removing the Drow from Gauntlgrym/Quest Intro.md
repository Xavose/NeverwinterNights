# Overview

Though broken disbanded and defeated. The drow have not given up the last of Gauntlgrym. 

Deep beneath the heart forge, the remants of house Xorlarrin seek to anger the primordial Athrogate enough that it destroys the dwarven settlement above. Their plan it to drop a drop of ever water into Athrogate's core. The drop was harvested from the elemental plane of water and is deadly to any beings that rely on flame to survive. To extrocate itself from the drop, Athrogate would have to move it's mass from the current cavern which would cause devistation in Gauntlgrym. The drow have prepared teleportation circles to allow their escape.

# Preparation

Bruenor knows the drow well having faught them several times himself. He knows the party is not equiped to deal with them as they are now. He is willing to gift them two of his last three spell scrolls of daylight for emergency use. He warns them not to die on their account.

# The Drow

House Xolarrin is a shadow of it's former self. Broken, abandoned, and seeking revenge they dedicate the remains of their once proud house towards destroying the dwarves that drove them out. 

While greatly diminished from what they once were, the drow are far from defenseless. Tiear'tierren, priestess of Lolth leads her house towards this last ditch effort of revenge. Tiear's mother and three sisters were murdered by the clan battlehammer in the dwarven takeover of Gauntlgrym. She pursue's Bruenor's death above all else. 

Tiear's house consists of the following: 

1x Drow Mage (Drakien) who keeps the ever water on his person.

5x Drow Elite Warriors who act as her squad leaders. 

25x Drow who mostly act as non combatants and instead seek to further their matron mother's goals.

If a drow squad is confronted, the Elite will stand back and command his troops until he feels the characters are a significant threat. The Elite will prioritize their own survival over that of the gunslinger. They both attack character's who look like the least threat and will retreat if they feel the fight swing in the party's favor.

After the character's deal with at least two squads, if any servivors make it back to inform the other's the remianing elite warriors will band together to route out and kill the party. If Drakien is forced to act he will try to kill the party by any means. 

# Locations of the Drow

As the player's descend down towards the heart forge they quickly encounter a labrynth of tunnels. The map from Bruenor is useful in navigating the tunnels, but they have changed a good deal since this map was constructed. 

The party member doing the navigation will need to succeed on a DC 15 Survival check to succesfully navigate the tunnels and avoid danger. On a failure, the party stumbles upon one of the tunnel's denizens. Roll a d8 and determine the results using the table below.
