# Random Encounters

**Before the party embarks on their journey be sure to decide how they are traveling through the tunnels. Are they moving together? Are they carrying a torch? Who can and cannot see?**

As the party progresses through the depths of Gauntlgrym they will need to roll a suvival check to determine if they can discern the correct directions based on an old map and tunnels that have changed greatly over the centuries. 

The original check for this DC is 15. Once a character succeeds this DC all subsequent DCs are 10. The characters need to pass 3 checks total to make it to the great forge. On a failure they will encounter one of the follwoing:

## Dwarf and Drow battle remnants

```
As you wind through Gauntylgryms many halls you see up ahead a large stone door broken to pieces. Through the doorway the thick smell of death and decay floods the tunnel.

WIth the aid of light it is easy to diesern black scorch marks along the ground leading to the tunnel as well as entering into the doorway. Parts of the stone look melted and chared black from some intense heat. 
```

When Brunor first stormed these halls he called upon favors with powerful mages to summon elementals of earth and fire to route out the drow. These elementals did not discern between man, woman, or child; slaying all drow in their wake. 

In this small chamber several drow families took refuge until a fire elemental came to claim them.

With a successful DC 15 investigation check the party can uncover a random magic item from table F burried amongst the ashes.

## Unbound Elemental

One of the ways Tiear protected her survivng people was by cutting off a few elementals from their controllers. These elementals went berserk and are now trapped within the halls of gauntylgrym. Should the party fail to this point they will happen uppon one of the Earth Elementals. This Earth Elemental uses the normal stat block accept it is enraged beyond normal, giving it advantage on all attacks and addvantage on all attacks against it. 

## Saccrifice Chamber

```
Ahead, you see the tunnel open up to a large carved out chamber with thick webs blocking the path forward. 

(Once the players figure out how to bypass the webs)

The chamber appears large and mostly round, with brazers forming a ring around a central platform. At the center of this platform webs cover a 5ft large mound that you cannot see through. 
```

Here, Tiear conducted a hasty ritual to break the magic controlling the elementals beset uppon her people. She saccrificed a newborn baby to lolth in exchange for protection. Lolth is very displeased at how Tiear has lead her people here, as well as her failures. 


Should the party disrupt the saccrificial alter in any way they will be attacked by a drider(A sick forshadowing of fates to come)

# Planned Encounters

Should the party succeed on their survival checks they will find themsleves moving quickly towards Tiear and her drow party. For each success, the party will encounter one of the below scinarios. 

## Drow Excavation

Here, several drow are lead by an expert. The drow are working with pick axes and drills to find a chute of soft rock that leads downward to the primoridal beneath Gauntylgrim. Should the drow become aware of the party before the others they will use a thunderstone to bring Umberhulk towards their location while making a getaway themselves. 

## Drow Elites

Once the drow are allerted to the party's presence the remaining elites will band together to confront the party. The drow know these tunnels well and will try to confront them on favorable grounds. 

The party must succeed on a DC 17 perception check. On a failure, the leading party member fails to notice the pit trap and the first two characters drop 20 feet to the ground and land in a fungal infested cavern.

Upon their landing three veterans will attack the two party members in the chamber while the remaining two attack the party member still in the tunnel. 

## Drow Mage

Should the Elites be defeated the drow mage, Drakien, will appear before the party. He is confident of his superiority but realizes that Tiear's days are numbered in the eyes of Lolth. He fears that this last ditch effort to destroy Gauntylgym might get him killed in her fervor. He tells the party that he will hand over the Ever Water if they first help him to defeat Tiear.

Drakien suggests that the party allow him to take them prisoner so they can get close to Tiear and then launch an attack (DC 15 insight check to realize he is still weighing his options, he hopes the party will come up with a better plan to prove their worth to him).

Should the party inquire, Drakien can happily inform them of some of the other denizens of Gauntylgrym. 

## Confronting Priestess Tiear'Tierren

Depending on how quickly the party makes their way here the Priestess has or has not had time to prepare. In the case she has not they are free to strike at her within her own chambers or in her thrown room. 

If the party has already dealt with the vetrans than Tiear's ally might only be the drow mage, or no one at all.  Should Tiear feel her life threatened in any way she will use her action to attempt to summon a Yochlol servant. Should this summon fail it is an indication that Tiear has fallen from Lolth's grace at which point the priestess will transform into a Drider and continue the fight.
