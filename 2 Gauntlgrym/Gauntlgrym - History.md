## History

### Origins

After the last [conflict](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tearfall "Tearfall") between [gods](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/God "God") and [primordials](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Primordial "Primordial") in [−31,000 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-31000_DR "-31000 DR"), the primordial [Maegera](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Maegera "Maegera"), tired of fighting and uninterested in following its fellow primordials to the world of [Abeir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abeir "Abeir"), entered in a coma-like sleep beneath the Crags, forming the caves that would later be called Gauntlgrym.

### Rise and Fall

Toward the end of the **Age of Elves** ([−22,900 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-22900_DR "-22900 DR") to [−1100 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-1100_DR "-1100 DR")), [Delzoun](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Delzoun "Delzoun") was established around [−3900 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-3900_DR "-3900 DR") and dwarven miners first dug the tunnels and chambers that would eventually become known as Gauntlgrym. The dwarves found unusual veins of magical ore, but in their digging, they encountered the slumbering primordial. After that disastrous encounter, Delzoun sealed the tunnels and focused on expanding their empire.

Millennia later, the primordial was rediscovered by the [arcanist](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arcanist "Arcanist") [Maerin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Maerin "Maerin") of [Illusk](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illusk "Illusk"). He convinced the dwarves of Delzoun to build a city around the mines of Gauntlgrym in order to harness the power of the primordial to create exceptional pieces of metalwork. Construction on the city began in the [Year of Seven Spirits, −335 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-335_DR "-335 DR"), as a joint effort between the human wizards of Illusk and the dwarves of Delzoun. Maerin and the [elven](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elven "Elven") wizards of [Iliyanbruen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iliyanbruen "Iliyanbruen") extended the reach of the "roots" of the [Host Tower of the Arcane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Host_Tower_of_the_Arcane "Host Tower of the Arcane") in Illusk to carry the cooling waters of the sea to the primordial. The famed dwarf artisan [Immar Fardelver](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Immar_Fardelver "Immar Fardelver") was involved in the construction of the city itself.

The city was completed fourteen years later in the [Year of Hollow Hills, −321 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-321_DR "-321 DR"), and became the home to dwarves from **Clan Goldspire**, humans from Illusk, and [Netherese](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese "Netherese") refugees from **Runlatha** and [Sundabar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sundabar "Sundabar").

The city fell during the [Orc Marches](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orc_Marches "Orc Marches") of the [Year of Terrible Anger, −111 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-111_DR "-111 DR"), but was resettled in the [Year of the Impenetrable Mystery, 141 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/141_DR "141 DR"), this time as a vassal of Illusk, who again aided the dwarves in their efforts. Unfortunately, after an invasion in the [Year of the Wolfstone, 153 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/153_DR "153 DR"), by [lycanthropes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lycanthrope "Lycanthrope") and [illithids](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illithid "Illithid") a mere twelve years after its resettlement, the city was left to the mind flayers for the next millennium. Many refugees of Gauntlgrym, infected with [lycanthropy](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lycanthropy "Lycanthropy"), fled to the [Gray Wolf Tribe](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gray_Wolf_Tribe "Gray Wolf Tribe"), spreading their curse to the [Uthgardt](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Uthgardt "Uthgardt").

### Illithid Rule

The illithids ruled over the city for over a millennium, keeping to the lower levels while leaving the trap-filled upper halls empty. They would later use the city as a base from which to attack the [Kraken Society](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kraken_Society "Kraken Society"), who had managed to injure their elder brain and managed to abduct and brainwash one of their own in the [Year of Many Bones, 1278 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1278_DR "1278 DR"). They would also find unexpected numbers when they accepted refugees from destroyed [Phanlinksal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Phanlinksal "Phanlinksal") in the [Year of the Weeping Moon, 1339 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1339_DR "1339 DR"), who aided them in their main goal which seemed to be the creation of half-illithid hybrid creatures.

The [Knights of Myth Drannor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_of_Myth_Drannor "Knights of Myth Drannor") would be only the second surface group to uncover Gauntlygrym, the first being the **Company of the Gryphon**. The Knights had found a previously undiscovered route through the Underdark from [Shadowdale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowdale "Shadowdale"). A group of goblinoids called the **Hargrath** later took over the upper levels.

In the [Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1363_DR "1363 DR"), the mind flayers of Gauntlgrym created the first [illithiderro](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illithiderro "Illithiderro"), or madminds. The madminds, who could breed amongst themselves, did so quickly and outnumbered their creators in only a few years. They successfully rebelled against the illithids, slaughtering most of their former masters and enslaving the [duergar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Duergar "Duergar") before coming to infest the lower levels like vermin.

Following the [Spellplague](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spellplague "Spellplague") of [1385 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1385_DR "1385 DR"), the [Abolethic Sovereignty](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abolethic_Sovereignty "Abolethic Sovereignty") sensed the presence of Maegera and wanted to harness its powers for their own ends. In order to control Maegera, a branch of the Sovereignty created the dreaded [Symphony of Madness](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Symphony_of_Madness "Symphony of Madness"). The first tests of the Symphony occurred a few years later, when the Sovereignty used the Symphony to corrupt the mind flayer's elder brain, something that in turn corrupted the mind flayers, turning them into [plaguechanged](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Plaguechanged "Plaguechanged") puppets of the Sovereignty.

### Waking of the Primordial

Around the [Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1451_DR "1451 DR"), the [vampire](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire "Vampire") [Korvin Dor&#39;crae](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Korvin_Dor%27crae "Korvin Dor'crae") followed the roots of the destroyed [Host Tower of the Arcane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Host_Tower_of_the_Arcane "Host Tower of the Arcane"), which still had traces of remnant [magic](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Magic "Magic"). Using his mist form, he easily passed through the deep caverns, and found that the roots were connected to the great forge of Gauntlgrym. He reported back to the [Thayans](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thayan "Thayan"), who sent [Dahlia Sin&#39;felle](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dahlia_Sin%27felle "Dahlia Sin'felle") and some allies to the ancient kingdom. Dahlia sought out the Delzoun dwarf, [Athrogate](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Athrogate "Athrogate"), and his drow companion, [Jarlaxle](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jarlaxle "Jarlaxle"). The group, including Dor'crae, who helped them navigate the dangerous caverns, finally reached Gauntylgrym. The [evil](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Evil "Evil") vampire knew that only a Delzoun dwarf could open the way into the great city, deactivate its traps, and disable the forge. After the great gates were swung open, the wards were safely passed, and the group came across the lever to disable to forge. Dor'crae mentally *[dominated](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dominate_person "Dominate person")* Athrogate, and he was forced to pull the lever, awakening the fire primordial, Maegera. The subsequent [volcanic eruption](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ruining "Ruining") destroyed the nearby city of [Neverwinter](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Neverwinter "Neverwinter").

In the [Year of the Elves&#39; Weeping, 1462 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1462_DR "1462 DR"), [Sylora Salm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sylora_Salm "Sylora Salm") tried to destroy the now ruined settlement of Neverwinter but she was stopped by the combined efforts of Jarlaxle, Athrogate, [Bruenor Battlehammer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bruenor_Battlehammer "Bruenor Battlehammer"), and [Drizzt Do&#39;Urden](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drizzt_Do%27Urden "Drizzt Do'Urden"). In an event later known as "the Summons", hundreds of dwarven [ghosts](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost "Ghost") emerged from Gauntlgrym and approached the descendants of Delzoun to beseech their help in repelling the invaders. The dwarves of [Clan Battlehammer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Battlehammer "Clan Battlehammer") in [Icewind Dale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Icewind_Dale "Icewind Dale"), as well as those of [Mirabar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mirabar "Mirabar"), heeded the call and helped turn back Sylora Salm, [Valindra Shadowmantle](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Valindra_Shadowmantle "Valindra Shadowmantle"), and the [Ashmadai](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ashmadai "Ashmadai"), but not before Bruenor and his faithful shield dwarf, [Thibbledorf Pwent](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thibbledorf_Pwent "Thibbledorf Pwent"), were fatally injured.

### Q'Xorlarrin

In the [Year of the Reborn Hero, 1463 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1463_DR "1463 DR"), a group of [drow](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drow "Drow") from [House Xorlarrin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/House_Xorlarrin "House Xorlarrin"), led by [Ravel Xorlarrin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ravel_Xorlarrin "Ravel Xorlarrin"), captured the forge area of the complex at the behest of [Matron Zeerith Q&#39;Xorlarrin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zeerith_Q%27Xorlarrin "Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin"), having been secretly prodded to do so by [House Baenre](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/House_Baenre "House Baenre"). The purpose was to create a sister city to [Menzoberranzan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Menzoberranzan "Menzoberranzan") that was free of the direct control of House Baenre and that would provide many valuable forged goods. Additionally, the city had the potential to afford greater rights to drow males and [driders](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drider "Drider"), as well as to improve access for [Bregan D&#39;aerthe](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bregan_D%27aerthe "Bregan D'aerthe") to send trade goods from the surface back to the Underdark. A brief setback occurred shortly after the occupation began when [Brack&#39;thal Xorlarrin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Brack%27thal_Xorlarrin "Brack'thal Xorlarrin"), the house elderboy, succumbed to the whispers of Maegera and tried to release the primordial once more, coinciding with an attack from a contingent of [Shadovar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadovar "Shadovar") led by [Herzgo Alegni](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Herzgo_Alegni "Herzgo Alegni").

By the [Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1484_DR "1484 DR"), the drow had secured the area around the forge and some of the lower mining tunnels, where they forced slaves to work. That year, House Xorlarrin received official approval to leave Menzoberranzan for the new settlement, which was named [Q&#39;Xorlarrin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Q%27Xorlarrin "Q'Xorlarrin"). Not long before Matron Zeerith was set to arrive, drow troops (under the command of [House Baenre](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/House_Baenre "House Baenre")) captured [Artemis Entreri](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Artemis_Entreri "Artemis Entreri") and his companions and tortured them or set them to work. The reborn [Companions of the Hall](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Companions_of_the_Hall "Companions of the Hall"), who entered Gauntlgrym to free Thibbledorf Pwent from his vampiric curse, learned about Entreri's captivity and set out to rescue him. In the ensuing fight, the drow were forced to retreat temporarily and many of the settlement's rooms were destroyed. However, Zeerith and [Matron Mother](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Matron_Mother "Matron Mother") [Quenthel Baenre](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Quenthel_Baenre "Quenthel Baenre") arrived and presumably moved to rebuild the city.

### Reclamation

In the [Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1486_DR "1486 DR"), the city was reclaimed by an army of dwarves from [Mithral Hall](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mithral_Hall "Mithral Hall") and [Citadel Felbarr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel_Felbarr "Citadel Felbarr") led by Bruenor Battlehammer, [Connerad Brawnanvil](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Connerad_Brawnanvil "Connerad Brawnanvil"), and [Emerus Warcrown](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Emerus_Warcrown "Emerus Warcrown"). In the aftermath of the fighting, Connerad of Mithral Hall was posthumously given the honor of being the first king of Gauntlgrym, followed by Emerus of Citadel Felbarr who also succumbed to his wounds shortly after. This left Bruenor as the third king of Gauntlgrym.
