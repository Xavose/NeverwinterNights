## Intrigue

- The players can discern that the dwarves are hesitent to fully accept them into their hospitality.
  - Neverwinter has cached in a lot of favors these past five years with very little to offer in return.
- If the players act well, they can be given a quest by the king.
  - Quest is to hunt down and remove the remaining drow presence in Gauntlgrym

## Bruenor Battlehammer (king of Gauntlgrym)

Bruenor is rather new to his kingship under the mountain as the dwarves only reclaimed the settlement five decades ago. He is much friendlier to the party than his fellow dwarves due to his background as an adventurer.
