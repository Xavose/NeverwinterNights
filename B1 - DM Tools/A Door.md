# Development

The party is currently greatly in debt within A Door. As a result all Con saves will increase by 2 the next time they come through. 

# How it happens

**Whenever a character rolls a natural 20 on perception or investigation a shimmering door appears. This door leads to the curious sanctum of Powder, an eclectic hoarder and interdimensional traveler. His sanctum is full of impressive items that the characters can look through. **

---

**Powder**

* **Provisioner of Fine things**
* **Sounds like bill cosby**

---

**Sebastion: Animated Scroll that does price checks and financial transactions.**

* **Sounds like Davey Jones**

---

**Any character who would like to just rummage about can make an investigation check. **

Time fluctuates differently within A Door and the more time the players spend looking the more time passess in the real world. 

The first investigation check consumes 12 hours of real world time and the player must succeed on a DC 10 Consititution save or gain a level of exhaustion. The second investigation check consumes 24 hours and the player must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save. The third consumes 48 hours and must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution save and so forth according to below

- 1st check
  - 12 hrs
  - DC 12
- 2nd Check
  - 1 Day
  - DC 16
- 3rd Check
  - 2 Days
  - DC 20
- 4th Check
  - 4 Days
  - DC 24
- 5th Check
  - 8 Days
  - DC 30
- 6th Check
  - 16 Days
  - DC 34
- 7th Check
  - 32 Days
  - DC 38

What a player finds for each roll is determined by the results below

* 1-5: Roll once on Treasure Hord Challenge 0-4
* 6-10: Roll with advantage on Treasure Horde Challenge 0 - 4
* 11-15: Roll once on Treasure Hord Challenge 5 - 10
* 16 - 20: Roll with advantage on Treasure Horde Challenge 5 - 10
* 21 - 25: Roll once on Treasure Horde Challenge 11 - 16
* 26 - 30: Roll with advantage on Treasure Horde Challenge 11 - 16

If a player is looking for a specific item. If they roll high enough on both their investigation check and the magic item tale rolls that they roll above what would be required to find that item then they can choose to find that item instead. 

Items that are found are free, but something must be left in its place per item.
