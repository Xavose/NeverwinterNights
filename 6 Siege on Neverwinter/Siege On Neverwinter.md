# Previous Session Notes

The party has closed the North most gate and defended the city walls.

# Plot

King Obould of the Many Arrow tribe united all of the orcs in the Frozen North under one banner and saught to create a treaty with the City of Neverwinter and join his orcs as part of the Citizens of Neverwinter.

The City of Neverwinter sent Dalen Red TIger, a half orc and member of the Uthgardt tribes, to parlay with King Obould as well as a small group of adventurers.

When the envoy arrived at the Many Arrow Tribe, they were ambushed at the gate and informed that King Obould had been overthrown by the Many Chiefs. The adventurers chose to stand and fight rather than be taken prisoner.

In the months since, the Many Arrow Tribe has killed off King Obould and appointed Car'T'Rok as their new King. Car'T'Rok wants nothing more than the absolute destruction of Neverwinter.

Knowing that with the final ingrediant of the cure in hand, the City of Neverwinter will soon have it's cure to the wailing death, the Children of Origin have reached out to the Many Arrowed Tribe. They plan to use their agents within the city to lower the defenses of Neverwinter and let the Many Arrows Tribe raid and pillage the City.

Once again, the City of Neverwinter must call upon it's most promising adventurers to help defend it from the enemies both within and without in these darkest hours.

### Servant of Origin

The Servant of Origin plans to use the siege as a distraction to break into the Temple of Tyr (where the cure is being held) and take the cure for himself. He poses as one of the trusted allies to the Inner Circle of Neverwinter and lets everyone know that he will defend the cure during the siege.

### Sleeping Agents

Throughout the siege, secret servants of origin will try to disrupt the plans of the city defenders by any means necessary

Examples

- A civilian cries out "For the Masters!" before plunging a dagger into one of the defenders
- An agent posing as a City Guard will sabatoge the city defenses

All sleeping agents carry with them a defiled mark of Helm, which helps protect them from the wailing death.

# Conclusion

The Players have pushed back the siege and Neverwinter still stands proud in the rising dawn. But a more sinister plot was revealed. Desther, the would be savior of Neverwinter and Leader of the Helmites has revealed himself to be none other than the Servant of Origin. Using his position of power, he was able to steal the cure and abscond to Helms Hold.

Our heroe's must now flea to helms hold and use whatever means available to them to put a stop to Desther and his plans once and for all.
