**3 - EXIT TO LEVEL 2: COMBAT ROUTE**

There are two routes to follow to complete the challenge either from area #3 or area #5. If you follow this path you will get down to level 2 of Mutamin's Challenge. This route is longer and requires many fights in order to complete the challenge but has no riddles. Before you can continue from here though, you have a face a Queen Spider which is very difficult to defeat so you might want to be prepared before you engage.

The correct answer to the first riddle is: 15, answering wrongly will result in a fight with the Yuan-Ti. If you are correct you can pass and exit the level from area #5 or stay and answer another riddle. The answer for the second riddle is: 12 trinkets and 5 girls. If you answer correctly the Yuan-Ti will reward you will a Crystal Frog. When you finish with the Yuan-Ti continue to area #5 to exit this level.

**5 - EXIT TO LEVEL 3: RIDDLE ROUTE**

This is the second exit from this level. However this exit will take you directly down to level 3 where you will have to answer to some more riddles in order to continue and finish the competition.
