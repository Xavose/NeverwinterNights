| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 - EXIT TO LEVEL 2**

This exit will take you back to Mutamin's Challenge Level 2.

(**NOTE:** Areas #2-#3 are only accessible from area #5 at Mutamin's Challenge Level 1)

**2 - EXIT TO LEVEL 1**

This exit will take you back to Mutamin's Challenge Level 1.

**3 - PUZZLE ROOM**

The statue at the middle of this area has another riddle for you. Touch the statue to receive the riddle. Dydd's (another competitor) Journal along with his body can be found near the statue as well. According to his journal number 16 is definitely not the right answer. When you figure out the answer of this riddle (the answer is 19) proceed to the appropriate room according to the signs next to each door and open the chest there. Inside you will find the Green Griffon Puzzle Door key and a powerful random magical item probably the Belt of the Hill Giant Strength. The key opens the door to the door, so that you can gain access to the rest of the level.

**4 - PILLAR OF LIGHT**

A pillar of Light is located here. Another competitor called Gam can be found near the pillar to the east. He is severely injured and will ask you to help him. You can either heal him if you can cast healing spells or give him a healing potion. If you help him he will let you know that beyond the door to the east (area #5) several invisible creatures attacked him and almost killed him. He will also let you know that the creature are destroyed if the get to close to the Pillar of Light. So if you are having trouble with the Invisible Stalkers at area #5 you can lure then near the Pillar to destroy them.

**5 - INVISIBLE STALKERS**

Four Invisible Stalkers dwell in this room. It is almost impossible to fight them all together so you might want to use the Pillar of Light that is located at area #4. The Invisible Stalkers will be destroyed as soon as they get near to the pillar. However the grand a nice amount of experience if killed so you can leave one of two to kill them for your self.

**6 - CRYSTAL EGG**

After destroying the Invisible Stalkers proceed to this area and take another crystal item from the chest in this room. This time it is a crystal egg. By now you should have all four of the crystal items. They have their role to play once you reach the Competition Exit at area #8.

**7 - GORKAN**

The last of the competitor you've met upstairs at the Inn we come and attack you as soon as you enter this area. Gorkan will drop a Notched Great Axe. The Great Axe is actually the quest item for Daelan's Tale in Chapter 2. (See our [Henchmen Section](https://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/henchmen.php) for more details).

 **NOTE** : There are reports of a bug that causes Gorkan not to be hostile. If this happens you might want to load again here because when you finish the competition you cannot come back.

**8 - COMPETITION EXIT**

This is the final area of the Competition. Inside this area there is a statue and an empty glowing chest. This is also the place where you will need the crystal items. If you touch on a statue it will give you one last riddle. You actually have to place the right Crystal item according to the riddle in order to exit the competition. The correct item is the Crystal Egg. Placing the other crystal items summons different creatures to fight you, so you might want to take the fights for the experience points. See below as of what happens for each Crystal item:* **Crystal Egg** : Competition Exit (You are teleported back to the basement)

* **Crystal Skull** : Attacked by 3 Skeleton Warriors
* **Crystal Insect** : Attacked by 3 Umber Hulks
* **Crystal Frog** : Attacked by 3 Blue Slaggs (The Slaggs summon another 3 Red Slaggs)
