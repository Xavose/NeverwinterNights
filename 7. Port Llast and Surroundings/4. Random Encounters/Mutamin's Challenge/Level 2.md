| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 - EXIT TO LEVEL 1**

The exit at this area will take you back to Mutamin's Challenge Level 1.

**2 - CRYSTAL INSECT**

A Minotaur that lurks around here will drop another crystal item after you defeat him, this time you will get a Crystal Insect. Once again keep that with you until you reach the last area of the competition.

**3 - KASMA**

One of the competitors you've met upstairs before the start of the competition can be found in this area fighting with a Minotaur. Kasma doesn't seem to have a chance to survive against the Minotaur so you can either let her get killed or jump in and kill the Minotaur to save her. However she does not drop anything if killed and says/gives nothing if saved.

**4 - EXIT TO LEVEL 3**

Near this exit which takes you down to level 3 you will have to face a Minotaur Chieftain before you will be able to continue. This Minotaur Chieftain might prove a worthy opponent but it's nothing you can't handle. When defeated search the chests nearby for some random treasure and proceed to the exit.
