| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT**

These two areas will get you back to the surface and to the North Road Area.

**2 � ORC TEMPLE**

The temple of the Orcs is guarded by two Minotaurs. An Orc will free the Minotaurs by using the Floor lever as soon as you approach the area, but this is nothing you can't handle. Once again don't forget to search the area for treasure.

**3 � ORC KING**

The throne of the Orc King can be found here. However the King is protected by several Orc Elites and it will be hard to defeat him. Search the chests there afterwards for some nice items but beware of the traps.

**4 � TREASURE ROOM**

Several chests can be found it this room that contain some nice items, but before you reach them you must fight the Ogre that is guarding them.

**5 � GOBLIN KING**

Same as the Orc King chamber, but this time the Goblin King and his elite troops have to be fought. A moderate fight and a room full of loot.

**6 � BUGBEAR PRISONER**

Talk to the Bugbear Prisoner in this room to learn more about the caves. It is your choice as well of what to do with him. You can either free him or kill him.

**7 � STAIRS DOWN**

Follow the stairs to get down to the Bugbear Caves.
