| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � STAIRS UP**

Use the stairs to travel back to the Goblin and Orc Caves.

**2 � BUGBEAR KING**

The leader of the Bugbears is located in this room protected by a few more bugbears. This is a moderated fight so plan appropriately. Search the area for some loot after you are done with them.

**3 � PRISONS**

There are two rooms at the Prison Area. In the first one you will find a bugbear. Talk to him to learn a few things about the caves. In the second room Leah the wife of Gerrol is held prisoner. Free her for 125 experience points and tell her to return to her home. You can claim your reward afterwards from Gerrol once you are done with the humanoid caves.

**4 � KENNELS**

Once you reach this room a bugbear will release a dire wolf and a Pack leader against you. The Pack Leader might causes some problems but only if you are caught unprepared.

**5 � EXIT**

Cave exit to surface and to the North Road area.

**6 � STAIRS DOWN**

The stairs in this room will take down to the last and final series of caves, the Ogre Caves.
