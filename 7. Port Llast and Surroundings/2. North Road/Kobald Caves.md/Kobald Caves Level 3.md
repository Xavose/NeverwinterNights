| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � STAIRS UP**

This set of stairs will lead you back to the Bugbear Caves.

**2 � PRISON**

Inside the cell you will found Nuglat, an Ogre that is held captive. You can free him or kill him but before you do either he has some interesting things to say. He will reveal to you that the cult is somehow connected with the Ogre-mage Dergiad. A cultist named Ganon maybe behind the recent behavior of Dergiad and the strange raids of the humanoids.

**3 � DERGIAD'S LAIR**

Be prepared for a tough one here. You will have to face Dergiad and Ganon together along with several other goblins and Orcs. When you defeat all of them loot the place and don't forget to take Dergiad's Head and Ganon's Journal. Return Dergiad's Head to Gerrol the farmer and the Journal to Aribeth so that she can give you more pointer as of where to continue your search for the cult. However the Journal does not contain information about the location of the Cult's Hideout.

**4 � PORTAL**

Use the portal in this room to return to the surface just outside of the cave entrances. There are also a couple of chests to loot as well.
