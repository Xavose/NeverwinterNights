| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO PORT LLAST**

The road to the south will take you back to the town of Port Llast.

**2 � GERROL'S FARM**

The father of the young boy you've met outside of Kendrack's Barracks and his farm house is located here. Talk with Gerrol to learn more details about the disappearance of his wife Leah and about an Ogre-Mage by the name Degriad that Gerrol believes he is behind his wife's disappearance. Gerrol will ask to find and save his wife and if possible to bring back the head of Degriad. He wife and Degriad are located at the series of caves which you can enter from areas #5 and #6. For saving his wife Leach you will be rewarded with 150 gold pieces and 250 experience points plus 50 more gold pieces with a successful persuade skill check and for Degriad's Head with another 150 gold pieces and 250 experience points plus 50 more gold pieces with a successful persuade skill check.

**3 � SOLOMON'S AMBUSH**

After Solomon, the gnome at Alliance Arm Inn, give you a second warning to stop searching for the cult, the next time you exit Port Llast (from either exits), Solomon will be waiting for you along with 2 of his guards. After defeating him he drops a note, that says something about you and that you have to be stopped. You can return the note to Lady Aribeth but the note does not contain information about the Cult's location.

**4 � PORT LLAST OLD MINES**

The entrance to the Port Llast Mines can be found here. However you need a key before you can enter the mines. Kendrack will give it to you later on when you have to find Yesgar, the last of the escaped prisoners.

**5 � ENTRANCE TO GOBLIN AND ORC CAVES**

A few caves entrances take you down to a series of Caves where you will search for Gerrol's wife (see area #2) and for the any clues concerning the cult. These two take you the first set of caves, the Goblin and Orc Caves.

**6 � ENTRANCE TO BUGBEAR CAVES**

Same as areas #5 but this cave entrance takes you directly to the Bugbear Caves.

**7 � VARDOC'S HUNT**

Once again the cult will try to end your search. At some point later on you will be attacked by another cult agent here, this time Vardoc. After defeating him take the note from his body. This particular note contains information about the Cult's location and you will definitely need to bring the note back to Aribeth. The note is considered one of the clues that Aribeth needs to uncover the true location of the Cult. But you will need another lead before you will be able to enter the town of Luskan.

(**NOTE:** This encounter might occur elsewhere as well, after several NPCs inform you that Vardoc is on the hunt for you.

**8 � EXIT TO GREEN GRIFFON INN**

Follow the northern path to reach Green Griffon Inn and the Gate to Luskan.

**9 � EXIT TO THE EAST ROAD**

The path here will take you to the East Road Area and eventually to the Neverwinter Wood.
