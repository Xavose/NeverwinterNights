Once you find all three of the boys, return back here and you will find Sir Karathis inside the cave.

* You can go upstairs with her and then threaten her to give the Serpent Gem, which she will, considering you fooled her and separated her from the guard. You don't have to kill her this way or
* You can refuse to go upstairs with her but also without starting a fight. She will then pick on another patron of the Inn and she will eventually go upstairs with him. You can follow her and kill her (becomes hostile) when she is again separated from the guard, and take the gem afterwards.
