**13 � BOUNTY HUNT: DELILAH**

Delilah, one of the escaped prisoners has found shelter inside the Archeologist Barracks. Once again, as with all the escaped prisoners, you will have to fight her before you will be able to talk to her.

When you are done with her get her ear and return it back to Kendrack.
