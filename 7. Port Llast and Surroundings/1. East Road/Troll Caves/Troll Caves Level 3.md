| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO TROLL CAVES LEVEL 2**

This is the first area you will find as soon as you get down to level 3 of the Troll Caves. You can return to level 2 from here as well.

**2 � DARIUS**

A prisoner that goes by the name Darius, which obviously seems to have lost his mind, is held captive in this small cell. Through his ramblings you will be able to figure out that something that lurks below the Troll Caves is even worst that the Trolls, which apparently they are also afraid of. There is not much to do with this guy but you can set him free if you like.

**3 � MAGICAL TREASURE**

Inside this room you will find a trapped chest, since the game gives random items to most of the cases, you will not find any specific item here but most possibly a random magical item.

**4 � MORE MAGICAL TREASURE**

As in area #3 another chest here contains a random magical item, possibly a magical Light Flail.

**5 � EXIT TO CREATOR RUINS LEVEL 1**

Venturing down from here you will get to Creator Ruins Level 1, where you can continue your search for proof of the Creator Race and for some more magical treasures.
