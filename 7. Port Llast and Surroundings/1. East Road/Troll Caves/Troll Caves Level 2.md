| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO TROLL CAVES LEVEL 1**

These two exits on the level will take you back to Troll Caves Level 1.

**2 � EXIT TO SURFACE**

Exiting from here will bring you back to surface.

**3 � TREASURE LOOT**

This large area is full of spiders and a few Ettercaps. In the centre you will find a couple of chests that contain some treasure along with a few magical items.

**4 � MORE TREASURE**

A Troll Shaman protects the chest that is located in this small area. Once you defeat him search the chest and you will find a random, most likely, powerful magical item.

**5 � EXIT TO TROLL CAVES LEVEL 3**

When you are done with this level head to this area and follow your way through this exit to get down to the last level of the troll Caves Series.
