| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO TROLL CAVES STORAGE AREA**

Follow this path to get to the Storage Area of the Troll Caves.

**2 � TROLL NOTE**

A troll note can be found in one of the bodies in this area. It seems that Jax might be right about the Creator Ruins since according to the note even the trolls are afraid of the things that lurk below the Troll Caves.

**3 � EXIT TO TROLL CAVES LEVEL 2**

Exit down to the Troll Caves Level 2.

**4 � EXIT TO SURFACE**

By using any of these exits you will be transferred back to surface and to the East Road Area.

**5 � TROLL CHIEFTAIN**

The troll Chieftain along with several other trolls occupies this room. Again if you talked with Lenton up to the Archeologists Barracks you will know what to do with the Chieftain. Lenton asked you to bring the Head of the Troll Leader in an effort to avenge his brother death, so after defeating the Troll Chieftain pick up his head and return it to Lenton to collect your reward. The chieftain will probably be holding a random magical item as well.

**6 � JOURNAL OF SYNTH LA'NERAL**

A corpse which appears to be Synth's body is located in this corridor. After Linu ends her tale in Chapter 2 you will know that Linu would be very pleased if she could find the Journal of her beloved one. Searching the body you will find the Journal of Synth La'neral so don't forget to give it back to Linu.
