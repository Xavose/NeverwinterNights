| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO CREATOR RUINS LEVEL 1**

The exit from here takes you back to Creator Ruins Level 1.

**2 � SEAL GUARDIAN GOLEM**

Same as Level 1 a Guardian Golem protects the seal that blocks the way for you to area #4 where you can get down to Level 3. For this level the Golem requires a password before he can let you pass. The password you need is written in a scroll that can be found in area #3. Come back and to talk to the golem again as soon as you have the scroll. He will give you a key that opens the seal ahead and the way to Creator Ruins Level 3.

**3 � CREATOR'S SCROLL**

One of the chests here contains the Creator's Scroll that contains the password needed for the Golem in area #2. You can also find a Fire Opal and some strange looking healing potions inside (possibly standard items).

**4 � EXIT TO CREATOR RUINS LEVEL 3**

The exit here will take you down to the last level of the Creator Ruins.
