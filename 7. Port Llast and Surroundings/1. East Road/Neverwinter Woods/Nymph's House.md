| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO DEEP WOODS**

Use the exit from here to get back to the Deep Woods area. Keep in mind that once inside the Nymph's House you will witness some strange things. You will be attacked all the time from the Nymph's Slave until you find the Nymph.

**2 � HUMAN SLAVE**

The human slave in this locked room, unlike the others, will surrender and talk to you but only after you fight him. He seems to be taken and charmed by the Nymph and he does not even remember attacking you. He will give you some general information but noting more. You can let his loose or kill him afterwards.

**3 � TETARI**

Another missing Druid is located here that goes by the name Tetari. Talk with him to learn what he has found out so far and how he ended up in the Nymph's House. Then let him return to the Druid groove. You will gain 62 experience points for freeing him.

**4 � LOCK OF NYMPH'S HAIR**

Search the room here and you will find a Lock of Nymph's Hair. The lock is the quest item for Sharwyn's Tale in Chapter 2 so keep it with you until you are able to give the lock to Sharwyn. (See our [Henchmen Section](https://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/henchmen.php) for more information)

**5 � NYMPH**

Upon entering this room the Nymph of the house will come near you and try to charm you. She is not hostile however. When she fails to charm you, you will be able to talk with her. After a long conversation you will eventually figure out a possible way to enter the Realm of the Spirit and save it, but you will need a ceremonial dagger to try so. The ceremonial dagger is located inside the chest nearby along with a book called Treatise of the Spirit of the Wood that explains the ritual to enter the Realm. The chest also contains a Potion of Critical Wounds and the Mirror of Vanity. The Mirror of Vanity is needed later on so be sure to pick it up before you leave.
