| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO THE HEART OF THE FOREST**

This is the entrance room of Setara's House. You can use the door here to get back to the Heart of the Forest Area. Once inside the house you will have to face several Air Elementals, all kinds of Mephits, Invisible Stalkers and some Flesh Golems along the way.

**2 � IMASKARRAN TOME OF RESONANCE**

The glowing bookshelf in this area holds another one of the Tomes of Imaskar. This time you will find the Imaskarran Tome of Resonance, so don't forget to give it to Eltoora when you return to Port Llast again. However you will have to fight several Mephits that guard the room first.

**3 � BREE**

In one of the cells in the Prison you will find a Druid called Bree. She is actually one of the missing Druids but you cannot do anything to help her at the moment. In order to free her you must first bring the Mirror of Vanity to the witch Setara at area #4. Setara will then give you the key that unlocks Bree's Cell. When you have the key come here again to free Bree. Let her tell you what she found out about the Neverwinter Wood and then instruct her to return back to the Druid Groove. Like before you will be rewarded with 62 experience points for doing so.

**4 � SETARA**

When you enter this room Setara will come and talk to you. She needs the Mirror of Vanity from the Nymph's House in order to become beautiful again. Actually the mirror jut shows her beautiful but she still remains an ugly witch but she does not know that. Nonetheless she will reward you with another of the Serpent Gems, Setara's Gem, Setara's key that unlocks the cell of Bree at area #3 and 200 experience points. She will also mention a book called "Treatise of the Spirit of wood" (area #6) which it is actually the same book like the one at the Nymph's House and describes the ritual you need to perform to access the Realm of the Spirit.

When you are done talking to her search the room, but be careful from the traps though, and you will find some nice treasures and possibly a magical item along with some minor loot. Also one of the chests contains a Bodak's Tooth.

**5 � SETARA'S ROOM**

Inside the witch's room you will find a Magic Bag and some minor treasures. Once again be careful and search for traps first.

**6 � TREATISE OF THE SPIRIT OF THE WOOD**

A bookshelf in the room here contains the book called Treatise of the Spirit of the Wood that contains information as of how you can gain access to the Spirit of the Wood.
