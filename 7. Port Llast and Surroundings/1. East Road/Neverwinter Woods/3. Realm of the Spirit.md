| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � ENTRANCE TO THE REALM**

This is the place that you will be teleported after performing the ritual at the Spirit Falls at the Heart of the Forest Area. You must know that this is not the exit from the realm as well.

**2 � RELMAR**

A mad dwarf called Relmar can be found here. After a talk with him you will find out that he was the one who poisoned the Spirit of the Wood but now he is stuck here which apparently this was the reason that drove him to insanity, You will also find out that he is an agent of the cult and that he was send here to poison the Spirit. Due to his madness he will also give you the location of a vial which supposedly can cure the Spirit (area #3). In the end you will have to fight him. When defeated he drops his Journal and a random magical item. Relmar's Journal contains information about the location of the cult's hideout and the journal is to be considered a valid proof for Aribeth so be sure to return the journal back to her when you are done here.

**3 � SPIRIT POISON ANTIDOTE**

Inside this rubble and according to Relmar's sayings you will find a vial which is nothing more or less than the antidote to cure the Spirit of the Wood.

**4 � SPIRIT OF THE WOOD**

Before you can do anything here you must first fight the spirit, which manifests itself as a dear, until it comes to its senses. After that you can talk with it. It will show you how it was poisoned and then you can give it the antidote in order to cure it. When the spirit is cured it will transfer you back to the Heart of the Forest. The altars nearby are full of treasures including some magic items. You can come back again to the realm any time but in order to leave you will have to use the portal at area #5.

**5 � PORTAL**

This portal will take you back to the Heart of the Forest.
