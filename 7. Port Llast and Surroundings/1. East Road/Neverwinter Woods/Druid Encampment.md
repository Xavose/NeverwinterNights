| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO EAST ROAD**

Exiting from here will get you back to the East Road Area.

**2 � DRUID CAMP**

A druid camp is assembled here in order to prevent people from entering the woods since the forest became a dangerous place. It seems that something strange happened to the Spirit of the Woods and the animals attack everyone that enters the woods even Druids and Rangers. The Archdruid Aawill is the leader of the grove here. Talk to him to learn more about the situation with the Neverwinter Woods and about the Spirit of the Woods itself. Aawill will give you two new Quests. A couple of Druids have gone missing after venturing to the forest and he will ask you to search and find them if possible. He will also request from you to save the Spirit of the Woods if you can find a way into its realm.

See below as of where you can find the missing druids:* **Orlane** � Located at the cave along the Deep Woods area

* **Bree** � Located in Setara's House at the Heart of the Forest
* **Tetari** � Located in the Nymph's House at the Deep Woods

For rescuing each druid you will be rewarded with 300 gold pieces and 99 experience points after talking with Aawill. When you rescue all three of them talk with Aawill again to complete the Quest for the Missing Druids. Also when you do restore the Spirit of the Woods back to its normal state Aawill will reward you further with 500 experience points and a [Cloak of the High Forest](https://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/nwnwalkthrough/neverwinterwooddruidencampment.php#null).

Around the camp you will also meet several other Druids. If you are a Druid you can challenge the other Druids in the Druid circle Challenges but you will first have to speak with Jaer in area #3 to learn more of the challenges and of how to participate into the circle challenge. Unfortunately you can not persuade you way into the challenges if you not a Druid. (Since I've played the game with a Paladin I was not able to give more details about the Circle Challenges. If you have more information about the Druid circle Challenges drop as an [email](mailto:webmasters@gamebanshee.com)).

**3 � JAER**

Jaer is in charge for the Druid Circle Challenges. Talk to her if you are a Druid if you want to enter the challenges. She can however give some general information about the Woods to players of other classes.

**4 � WYVERN**

Wyvern is one of the escaped prisoners, and you will need his tattooed ear if you took the Bounty Hunt Quest from Kendrack over at Port Llast. As soon as you approach him he will run back inside this small isolated area asking for help. If you follow him he will set off his ambush and attack you along with his animal companions. Once again you will have to fight him before you will be able to talk with him. He will let you know of his site of the story and he is willing to cut off his ear in order to save his life. But the choice is yours, you can either kill him, he will probably drop a magic item (possibly [Scabbard of Blessing](https://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/nwnwalkthrough/neverwinterwooddruidencampment.php#null)), or let him leave after handing you his ear.

**5 � DREGIN AND EXIT TO THE DEEP WOODS**

A man called Dregin guards the path here. He is here to prevent people from entering the forest because it has became a dangerous place and acts under Aawill's command. With that said he will not let you pass unless you speak with Aawill and agree to help the Druids with the problems involving the Neverwinter Woods. The exit will take you to the Deep Woods area, so be prepared to witness what happened to the Neverwinter Wood first hand.
