| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO SOUTH ROAD AREA**

Use the exit here to return back to the South Road area.

**2 � TREATISE ON FORGOTTEN HEROES**

On a body it this room you will find a book labeled Treatise on Forgotten Heroes. The book contains information about a hero called Maegel of the Mirialis Clan. You will find his tomb later on.

**3 � WELL**

A strange well can be found here. With enough Constitution you will be able to climb down the well and reach the other side on area #4 where the tomb of Maegel is located.

( **NOTE** : Near the wells at areas #3 and #4 you will find some Potions of Endurance. If your character has a low Constitution score, you can use these potions to make it the over side and vise versa.)

**4 � OTHER SIDE**

After climbing down the well in area #3 you will get to this isolated area. When you are done here you must again use the well to get back.

**5 � REMAINS OF MAEGEL**

When you reach the room, pull the descending chain and the ghost of Maegel will appear. Talk to him and he will eventually ask you what the name of his Clan is. According to the book the clan's name is Mirialis. You can tell him the correct answer or pretend that you know it (you will gain 250 experience points), but either way the ghost of Maegel will disappear afterwards. You can then search Maegel's remains and you will find the [Watchman&#39;s Helm](https://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/nwnwalkthrough/maegelcave.php#null) and some random treasures.
