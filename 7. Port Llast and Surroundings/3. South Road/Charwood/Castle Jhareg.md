**1 � EXIT TO CHARWOOD VILLAGE**

Use the door from here to get back to the Charwood Village.

**2 � RIDDLE CHEST**

Inside the Riddle Chest you will find a letter and the Riddle Key. Also in this room you will find three locked doors. Each door represents a different path of Justice. You can only choose to follow one path by using the riddle key to unlock one of the doors in the room. There are three doors thus three paths:

* **Right Path: The Undead Path** (Area #5). You will have to face several undead creatures in order to reach to area #6. The path acts as the representative path for Quint, since when you reach his chambers you will find out that there are full of undead.
* **Left Path: The Fire Path** (Area #4). You will have to face several creatures of fire in this area before you can access the other side of the castle and area #6. The path will give you a taste of you can expect at Karlat's Chambers and the representative path for Karlat the second of the Jhareg brothers since once in his chambers you will face several fire creatures.
* **Straight Path: The True Path** (Area #3). This is the true path and you will not face any enemies. There are also several chests and containers that contains a few magic items and treasures to this areas.

At the end of each path you will find another chest which contains a note. The note grants information about the path you chose. If you chose the straight path you will also find a random powerful magic item as well in the chest as a reward for making the right choice.

**4 � THE FIRE PATH**

You will have to face several creatures of fire in this area before you can access the other side of the castle and area #6. The path will give you a taste of you can expect at Karlat's Chambers and the representative path for Karlat the second of the Jhareg brothers since once in his chambers you will face several fire creatures.

**5 � THE UNDEAD PATH**

You will have to face several undead creatures in order to reach to area #6. The path acts as the representative path for Quint, since when you reach his chambers you will find out that there are full of undead.

**6 � THE CHAMBER OF JUDGMENT**

When you reach this area from any of the three paths you will find a Guardian Spirit in the middle. The Spirit will let you know that Lanthander the God of Morning has allowed the village to fall into the Weave of Time because of an unspeakable crime committed by the Jhareg Brother, Quint and Karlat. The spirit will also bestow on you the duty of the Judge for the Trial of the Jhareg brothers. So you will have to travel to each tower, of both Karlat's and Quint's, and acquire their written oath so that you can form a judgment. The Guardian Spirit will also give you the Jhareg Key of Judgment that unlocks the door up ahead.

When you have the written oaths of both Quint and Karlat come back here to the Chamber of Judgment and talk to the Spirit for more instructions and to begin the trial. You can also acquire the written oath of the Demon Belial at Karlat's chambers which appears to be the main reason for the crime that took place in the castle.

According to what you decide the following will happen:

* **Find Karlat guilty** : You will gain 500 experience points and the village along with all its inhabitants will be free from the doom. Returning back to the town area you will only find the Ruins the town of Charwood and the spirit of the Mayor Mobley waiting there to thank you. You will also be rewarded with another 299 experience points and with a chest that will appear next to Mobley. The chest contains 500 gold pieces and some other treasures. (see also Charwood � Town Ruins area Walkthrough)
* **Find Quint guilty** : You will gain 375 experience points and again the village will be free from the weave of time. However since by convicting Quint you also gave the phylactery to Karlat you will find out that the town of Charwood in now full of Red Slaads and Fire elementals. Also Mayor Mobley will also be waiting at the entrance of the castle once you get out but this time he will not be so kind with you. (see also Charwood � Town Ruins area Walkthrough)
* **Find neither guilty and leave the phylactery to the Guardian Spirit** : (You must obtain the written oath of the Demon Belial to have this choice). You will gain 375 experience points but you will also leave the whole town under to veil of the Weave of time and the internal darkness. However the good thing is that you will also trap the Demon here as well. Returning back to the town you will see for your self that nothing changed.
* **Find neither guilty and keep the phylactery** : (You must obtain the written oath of the Demon Belial to have this choice). You will gain 375 experience points and the phylactery and you will also free the village from the internal night. Once again the spirit of Mayor Mobley will be waiting for you once you get out of the castle to thank you and give you a chest that contains 500 gold pieces and some other treasures as your reward. You will also gain an additional 299 experience points. (see also Charwood � Town Ruins area Walkthrough)
