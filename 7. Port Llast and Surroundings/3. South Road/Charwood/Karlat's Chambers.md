| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO THE CASTLE'S MAIN FLOOR**

Use the exit from here to get back to the Chamber of Judgment at the Jhareg Castle. Also be prepared, once you are in Karlat's chambers, to face several creatures of fire like Fire Elementals and Red Slaads.

**2 � KARLAT'S PROTECTION WAND**

Search the small room here and you will find Karlat's Protection Wand in one of the containers. You will need the wand to summon the Demon at area #6 if you not a mage.

**3 � KARLAT'S BURNING WAND & KARLAT'S KEY**

Inside the flaming chest in this room you will find Karlat's Burning Wand and Karlat's Key. The wand is to be used at area #6 if you want to summon the Lord of Fire and you are not a mage. The key unlocks the doors at area #8 where you will find Karlat himself.

**4 � JOURNAL OF KARLAT JHAREG & THE LORD OF FIRE**

A huge tome inside this room contains information as of how Karlat was supposed to summon a demon called Belial, the Lord of Fire. By following the instructions you can perform the ritual yourself and summon Belial at the Summoning chambers at area #6. You can also find the Journal of Karlat Jhareg inside the chest of drawers nearby. The journal tells the truth about what Karlat did the night of the slaughter and vital information about whose fault was to use at the trial.

**5 � MAGIC INGREDIENTS**

Search the chests inside this small room and you will find several magic ingredients along with a vial of Dragon's Blood.

**6 � KARLAT'S SUMMONING CHAMBERS**

Inside these chambers you can actually call upon the Lord of Fire, the Demon Belial. The huge tome at area #4 contains information as of how you can perform the ritual.

You have to place a fire beetle belly into the blazer and cast protection from evil on yourself. Then cast burning Hands on the blazer and Belial the Demon will appear. Keep in mind that if you do not cast protection from evil the demon will attack you as soon as he appears. Also if you cannot cast these two spells you can use the two wands, Karlat's Protection Wand and Karlat's Burning Wand you acquired from areas #2 and #3. When you finally summon the Demon you can do the following:

* Ask for a powerful item. The Demon will give you the [Staff of Power](https://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/nwnwalkthrough/karlatschambers.php#null)
* Ask for protection. The demon will cast a protective spell on you or
* Ask about the slaughter

If you chose to ask him about the slaughter you will then find the true cause of the crime which is nothing else the Demon itself. You can then ask him to give you his written oath as well to use at the trial, and to make the right decision.

**7 � IMASKARRAN TOME OF FIRE**

On the bookshelf you will find several ingredients, a piece of ironwood and a vial of fairy dust. Also the flaming chest contains the Imaskarran Tome of Fire which you can return to Eltoora at Port Llast before you will be able to create the magic item that the Tome describes.

**8 � KARLAT JHAREG**

Use Karlat's Key you've obtained from area #3 to gain access to the room where you will find Karlat Jhareg. Once inside talk with Karlat and he will at first accuse his brother for the crime concerning the slaughtering of the kids of the Charwood village. However you know what happened from his journal at area #4 so eventually Karlat will tell you the true story about the night of the slaughter, if you insist, and he will give you his written oath as well. When you have both the written oaths from the Jhareg brother (and Belial's written oath) you can return to the Guardian Spirit at the main floor of the castle to start the trial.
