**1 � EXIT TO THE SOUTH ROAD AREA**

The path brings you back to the Farmlands on the South Road.

**2 � OLD SCROLL**

Inside a chest around these ruins you will find an old scroll along with some minor treasures. The scroll provides the answer you need for the runes on the Pillar at area #3.

**3 � MAGIC PILLAR**

A strange pillar lays here. You cannot do anything at the moment but after searching the bodies near it you will find a book labeled Explorer's Journal on one of them. With this book you will be able to translate the runes on the pillar and solve the riddle. The journal mentions a way to travel to an Ancient Netheresse temple and to the ruins of Gar-Atol. Pressing the correct runes on the pillar will result in the destruction of the pillar giving its place to a magic portal. By using the now visible portal you can get to the isolated place at area #4, right before the entrance to an ancient crypt which appears to be the Netheresse Temple. The correct answer according to the old scroll you found in area #2 is:

"Nether" + "Shall" + "Rule"

**4 � ENTRANCE TO THE HAUNTED CRYPT**

Once you use the portal from area #3 you will be transferred here before the entrance of the Haunted Crypt. Keep in mind that you cannot get back form here but instead you will need to use the portals from inside the crypt.

**5 � EXIT TO THE CHARWOOD VILLAGE**

If you want to reach Charwood Village this is path you have to use to get there.
