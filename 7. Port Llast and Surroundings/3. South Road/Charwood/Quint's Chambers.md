| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO THE MAIN FLOOR OF THE CASTLE**

Through this door you will get back to the main floor of the castle and to the chamber of Judgment.

Also be prepared to fight several undead creatures inside these chambers before you will be able to reach Quint when you arrive.

**2 � POTION CREATION**

Inside this room you will find some notes that give information of how to create several potions. There is also an alchemist apparatus here to perform the creation of the potion. You can create several potions (those available in the game). All you have to do is to place a healing kit and an empty bottle onto the apparatus and then cast the appropriate spell. (Cure light wounds spell creates a potion of that effect and so on). You can find several empty bottles and a few healing kits nearby to use.

**3 � QUINT'S KEY**

Search the chest inside this small round room and you will find Quint's Key you need, to access his private chambers at area #7.

**4 � SHRINE OF LANTHANDER**

A statue of Lanthander the Morning Lord can be found in the middle of this hall. The statue is desecrated from the blood of the innocent children that were slaughtered and stands as a reminder of that day and that the Morning Lord has doomed the whole village for it.

**5 � IMASKARRAN TOME OF DEATH**

Inside the flaming chest you will find one more of the Tomes of Imaskar labeled as the Tome of Death. As always return the Tome to Eltoora at Port Llast and you will also be able to create the magic item that describes. In this room you will also find a huge bloodstained book which appears to be a children's book. This book along with another one in area #6 was probably the tool Quint used to lure the children to the castle and cause their foul death.

**6 � BLOODSTAINED BOOK**

Another huge book stands as proof of the children's slaughter here. The book still holds the blood of the kids after Quint brought them to the castle.

**7 � QUINT JHAREG**

Quint tortured by his conscience will openly admit that he was the one that brought the kids to their doom and will gladly give you his written oath after a short talk with him. But things are not always as they look and you have to dig further before you will be able learn about the true cause of the slaughter thus be able to make the right judgment.
