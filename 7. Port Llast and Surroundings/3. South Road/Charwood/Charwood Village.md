| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

**1 � EXIT TO THE HAUNTED FOREST**

Follow the path from here to get back to the Haunted Forest area. This is also the entrance to the doomed Village of Charwood. As you will soon find out the village in no longer part of the real world but it has been cast out of time and doomed into eternal night.

**2 � QUINT**

A man named Quint will appear and talk to you as soon as you enter the village. There is definitely something wrong about the village but you will find out about it later. At the moment the only things you can hear from Quint are some strange words concerning a slaughter, but you cannot make any sense. When he finishes his rumbling he will disappear out of the thin air. But first he will trigger "The village of he Internal night" Quest.

**3 � CHARWOOD INN**

Inside the Inn you will meet with a strange man. He will say to you that the cult send him to search for an artifact here at the Charwood village but he won't give any more information about it, in fact he will attack you soon after you are done talking with him. Defeat him and he will drop the Charwood Journal along with some random treasure. The Journal contains solid proof on the cult's hideout so it is vital that you return it to Lady Aribeth once you are done here.

**4 � MAYOR HOUSE**

The Mayor of Charwood can be found inside this building. As you may have already noticed the village is somewhere lost in time and so the people here. Most of the time, they say thing you do not understand or things that happened ages ago, though they do not know that. Things like that you can expect to hear from the Mayor as well. Talk with him and he will let you know amongst other things about the slaughter of the kids of village from the Jhareg brothers, which apparently was the reason for the doom that befallen the village. The village in no longer a reality but is it now a place of eternal darkness in the weave of time.

**5 � ENTRANCE TO THE JHAREG CASTLE**

The entrance of the village's castle is located here. Enter it in a hope to learn more about what happened and solve the mystery that covers the whole village. Inside you will also reach the chambers of Jhareg Brother, Quint and Karlat.
