**(After finding Karlat guilty or chose to protect the Phylactery)**

**1 � TOWN RUINS**

The decision that you will make during the trial of the Jhareg brothers inside the castle has an effect to the entire village. If you found Karlat guilty or chose to protect the phylactery of the demon Belial then when you exit the castle you will find out that the doom on the town is no more and the town is once again part of the world. However you will find out that the town now lies in ruins and all of its people are long gone. You will only find a few wild animals in the ruins.

**2 � MAYOR MOBLEY**

The Mayor of the former town of Charwood will be waiting for you here in a ghostly form to thank you for freeing the village from the eternal night. A chest will also appear near him which contains your reward for helping the people of Charwood. Inside you will find 500 gold pieces and some random treasures, possibly a powerful magical item.

**3 � EXIT TO THE HAUNTED FOREST**

Travel to the now ruined town of Charwood and exit the area to get back to the Haunted Forest area.

**(After finding Quint guilty)**

**1 � TOWN RUINS**

The decision that you will make during the trial of the Jhareg brothers inside the castle has an effect to the entire village. If you found Quint guilty for the slaughter when you return to the town area you will see that the town now lies in ruins but it is also filled with Red Slaads and Fire elementals.

**2 � MAYOR MOBLEY**

The Mayor of the former town of Charwood will be waiting for you here in a ghostly form, but this time he will not thank you but instead curse you for making such a foul decision. You will not get any reward from him as well.

**3 � CREATURES OF FIRE**

As you will soon find out the road to the exit of the town can prove quite difficult now. You will have to face several Red Slaads accompanied by a few Fire Elementals all to the way to area #4 so be well prepared.

**4 � EXIT TO THE HAUNTED FOREST**

Once you make it here, use the exit to return back to the Haunted forest area.
