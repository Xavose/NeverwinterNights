Next to a great oak tree, you will find a man named Nyatar. If you are a druid or ranger (or make a successful persuade check), he will tell you that animals are suffering from the plague at Neverwinter's zoo. He will ask that you free four creatures from the zoo - a bear, panther, wolf, and lion. If you accept, he'll give you a key to the zoo, a Transport Via Plants scroll, and some Scented Fetish that will allow you to speak to the animals with the skill of a druid or ranger.

He also has a variety of equipment to sell but it's mostly directed to Druids and Rangers.

When the animals at the zoo are freed, return here to collect your reward from Nyatar. You will then be rewarded with 200 experience points, 400 gold pieces and with a successful persuasion check you will also earn a piece of Ironwood.

Nyatar is also a druid merchant.
