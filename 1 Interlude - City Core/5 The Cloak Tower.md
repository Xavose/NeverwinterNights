# From Game

The Cloaktower is home to **Eltoora Sarptyl**, leader of the **Many-Starred Cloak** guild. If you are a Sorcerer or Wizard (nope, no persuasion checks on this one), you can offer to join the guild. She will ask that you bring her a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood from the arcane laboratories of the Many-Starred Cloak located throughout Neverwinter. She will then tell you that each lab is marked with a sundial and give you a key to enter them. In addition, she will also sell various magic items, including mage robes and quite a few spell scrolls.

Below you can find the locations of these rare items Eltoora wants in order to let you join the guild:

* **Rare Earth Clay ** : Wizard Lab at Peninsula District
* **Kindling Wood ** : Wizard Lab at Beggar's Nest
* **Flask of Water ** : Wizard Lab at Docks District
* **Puff of Fog ** : Wizard Lab at Blacklake District

With all these items in your possession return here and gave them to Eltoora. She will then offer you a final test. The test requires of you to step into the portal nearby and defeat one of Eltoora's special Automatons. You will also be rewarded with 300 experience points for retrieving these items. When you enter the portal you will have some time to get the wands from the various containers there. Some of them can cast Stoneskin and slow. Slow will make your life easier if cast on the Minogon there. When you finally defeat the Minogon exit the chamber and speak with Eltoora again to complete your initiation. She will then congratulate you for earning a place amongst the member of the Many-Starred guild and she will also give you a cloak, the Many-Starred cloak, along with another 300 experience points.
