# District Notes

Giana Sortan, a Yuanti Priest and waterdavian creature has began to raise the plague ridden dead within the beggar's nest to create a new home for herself in Neverwinter. An outcast of her own kin, Giana hopes to harness the powers of necromancy to bring back her progenitors (the creatore race). Her efforts are in fact futile, but she has garnered the attentions of Orcus who wishes to entrap her soul as an eternal servant as well as use her as a seed for destruction.
