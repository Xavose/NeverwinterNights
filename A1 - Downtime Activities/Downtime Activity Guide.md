# General Rules for Down Time

If a character wishes to use their down time to progress in some manner (i.e. craft an item, garner renown from a guild, imrpove a skill, gain a feat, etc) then the following rules apply.

1. To begin the player must clearly state what their desired endstate from this downtime activity is.
   1. Examples:
      1. I want to craft a +1 longsword
      2. I want to become proficient in woodcarver tools
      3. I want to gain renwon with the thieves guild
   2. Once the player has determined what they want to create, the DM can inform them what skill / tool proficiency they will be using to roll and weather or not they have the requisite proficiency needed to achieve that endstate.
2. Once the endstate is clearly defined the DM will set a cost for that endstate in gp (gold pieces).
   1. Examples:
      1. A +1 weapon costs 1020 gp
      2. Woodcarving is a pretty minor character advancement on par with like a non optimized 1st level spell. A wand of magic detection costs 1500 gp and grants access to an optimized 1st level spell. Lets say 500 gp as the cost for proficiency with a minor tool kit like this. A better tool kit such as poisoners or thieves tools would probably be worth more.
      3. Depending on the character's current level or renown the price for this could vary. If the player is just starting out it would probably be around 100 gp to get from renown 0 to renown 1 (this is equivilant to a single significantly positive encounter). However, going from renwon 5 to renown 6 might be worth more like 10,000gp as that shows the character significantly increasing their already high status.
3. After establishing a cost for the endstate, the DM then determines the DC for whatever checks the player must make.
   1. Examples:
      1. DC for crafting a magic item: Common: DC 10, Uncommon: DC 13, Rare: DC 16, Very Rare: DC 19, Legendary: DC 22, Artifact: DC 25
      2. DC for gaining proficiency in woodcarver tools: I am thinking like DC 10 for woodcarver tools, they are pretty minor. Tinker tools, or disguise kit might be more like a 13, and poisoning or alchemy might be more like a 16.
      3. Renown with thieves guild: Here I think the DC would be 10 the players renown renown level with that guild. So going from 0 to 1 would be DC 10. Going from 5 to 6 would be DC 15.
4. Once DC and cost are established, the player must now spend gp equal to 10% of the total cost. This initial investment acounts for the cost of paying for materials (if crafting), training manuals or trainers (if training), or various lunches/gifts/bribes if trying to gain renown. This is a one time cost that does not need to be repeated unless otherwise specified. This initial cost is applied to the items Total Cost (clerified more below).
5. Once the upfront cost is payed, the player's character needs to now spend 4 hours of downtime committing to accomplishing that task. At the end of that period, the player can make whatever ability check was designated earlier against the designated DC to determine if they are successful. This roll will determine how much gp (if any) the character has completed towards the endstate's total cost.
   1. On a success, the character adds the amount of gp specified for their level below towards the Total Cost.
   2. On a success of 10 or more or a natural 20 the character adds double the amount for their level.
   3. On a failure, they add no gp.
   4. On a failure of 10 or more, or a natural 1, the character destroys the materials, relations, or skill books bought with their upfront cost. They character cannot attempt to continue this downtime activity until they have paid the upfront cost again. Additional upfront costs do not count towards the Total Cost.
   5. Gp per level.
      * Level 1: 15gp
      * Level 2: 60gp
      * Level 3: 135gp
      * Level 4: 240gp
      * Level 5: 375gp
      * Level 6: 540gp
      * Level 7: 735gp
      * Level 8: 960gp
      * Level 9: 1220gp
      * Level 10: 1500gp
      * Level 11: 1820gp
      * Level 12: 2160gp
      * Level 13: 2540gp
      * Level 14: 2940gp
      * Level 15: 3380gp
      * Level 16: 3840gp
      * Level 17: 4340gp
      * Level 18: 4860gp
      * Level 19: 5420gp
      * Level 20: 6000gp
   6. A character can attempt two of these checks (i.e. 8 hours worth of work) in any given downtime activity day. If they wish to make additional checks the DM may have the player roll to determine if they gain a level of exhaustion.
6. Once the results of the check have been determined and applied the PC can choose to either pay off the rest of the total cost in gp and complete the item right then. Or wait to make additional checks that require more downtime to pay off the rest of the endstate. Being able to pay off the total cost in this way accounts for the character paying for better materials/tools, paying for magical skill books that impart knowledge, or paying additional fees to bargains or bribes.
7. If the character fully accounts for the endstates total cost then they can update their character sheet to account for the additional bonus.
