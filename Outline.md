A Shadow Dragon has killed dozens of of Neverwinter Denizens and has sequestered itself in the tallest towers of Castle Never. There, it wages war against the undead spirits of Lord Never and his long dead courts. The players need a scale from the Shadow dragon and can either side with the Shadow Dragon or the Spirit of Lord Never to get the task done. Both are ultimately evil and may try to betray the party given the chance.

# Mad Wizards Tower

Heist

The mad wizard Malganin has gotten hold of the escaped Dryad and is keeping it prisoner inside the extrodimensional space of his wizard tower.

The players must navigate the aristocracy that is the black lake district to gain entry to Malganin's tower. Once inside they must find a way into his inner sanctum. 

- Before the characters get into the tower, they should see Malganin make a display of power on the city streets.
  - I am thinking he uses the imprisonment or feeblemind spells to debilitate a person.
- Make sure to leave hints that Malganin has an extrodimensional space.
- When to players do get to the Dryad, it tries to charm them into letting her go free.
