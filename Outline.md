A Silver Shadow dragon, Darthriax has made it's roost atop Castle Never. From there it wages a war against the Undying Spirit of Lord Never. The feud between these two has roots from milennia ago when Lord Never lead his elves in war against the dragons. In that time, the elves came into posession of the Dragon Flame, a powerful fire that allowed the elves to burn even the most mighty of dragons. Darthriax was just a young adult when his mother and father were both slain by Lord Never's forces. He vowed to one day return and take revenge upon the elven king.

# Mad Wizards Tower (Level 11)

https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/winter-wizardry

Heist

The mad wizard Malganin has gotten hold of the escaped Dryad and is keeping it prisoner inside the extrodimensional space of his wizard tower.

The players must navigate the aristocracy that is the black lake district to gain entry to Malganin's tower. Once inside they must find a way into his inner sanctum.

- Before the characters get into the tower, they should see Malganin make a display of power on the city streets.
  - I am thinking he uses the imprisonment or feeblemind spells to debilitate a person.
- Make sure to leave hints that Malganin has an extrodimensional space.
- When to players do get to the Dryad, it tries to charm them into letting her go free.

# Character Stories

## The Power of Nine (Zenith)

Zenith's father was long ago one of the Neverwinter 9, renown guards of Lord Haleuth Never. They helped Lord Never defeath the forces of Illusk. Afterwards, they supported Lord Never as he founded the City of Neverwinter and helped him defend his holdings till their dying day.

But, for two of the Nine that day came too soon, as one of their own turned on them and slew his brethren. This betrayer was executed for his crimes, had his name was stricken from all records, and his tomb was ripped from the **Vault of 9**. That betrayer, was Zenith's father, **Thracier Ramore**.

During his time in the Nine, Thracierserved with honor and dedication as a healer and protector. He drew his power from service to Athreos, the Elven god of passage. His connection allowed him to bring his allies back from the brink of death and heal those who had come to harm. But the weight of his dual service to both his king and his god rest heavy upon his shoulders.

This burden came to a climaxe late one winter evening when Thracier was given a vission from his lord that a plot was in action to kill Lord Never. Thracier begged for the killer's names, but Athreos demanded a price. In exchange for the would be killers, Thracier would have to renounce his connection to the Nine and accept a place as one of Athreos's reapers. Thracier grimly agreed, and was mortified to learn that two of his fellow nine were the betrayers, **Slade and Tamper**

Thracier confronted the Betrayers atop Castle Never. There, the three waged battle unbeknownst to his fellow Nine. With the powers of a fledgling reaper beginning to take hold of Thracier, he was able to overcome his foes and toss them over the tower walls to fall to their deaths. As the two betrayers were slain, Thracier's contract with Athreos was triggered, and his Oath to Lord Never and the 9 was severed as he ascended to become a full reaper.

The remaining Nine were pulled from their trance at the severed connection of three of their members. As the bodies of Slade and Tamper were found at the bottom of the Castle, broken and with wounds from Thracier's blade it was assumed Thracier had turned traitor and fled when he was confronted by his former Brothers. He was labled a traitor from that time on.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Millenium passed, with Thracier acting under his new role as a reaper. In this capacity, he became a Deva. He was known for carrying out swift and decisive justice, and never straying from his God's path. Until he one day fell into a trap by Zenith's mother, **Zennia**. She was trying to summon an undead spirit as part of a knowledge seeking assignment from her Hag patron. But the spell went ary and summoned a reaper instead. The two broke into a battle of wills as Thracier tried to break through her magical barrier while Zennia tried to maintain her hold for no reason more than her own survival.

Thracier was impressed by the woman's will power, that a mortal could rival his own divinely bestowed might. The two were such an even match that over a day passed before they both broke and collapsed on the floor, weak and defenseless.
