**Description:** A recent (and hasty) departure from [Calimport](https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Calimport "Calimport") led 'Grin' to [Neverwinter](https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Neverwinter "Neverwinter"). Now trapped in the slowly dying city, Grin works at odd jobs and tries to stay out of trouble.

He later appeared in [Waterdeep](https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep "Waterdeep") during the troubles with the [drow](https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Drow "Drow") attacks. His fate afterwards is largely unclear. He can be found at Level 2 of the Undermountain (south).

Tomi's portrait changes with a certain patch.

Tomi is notable because he can unlock most chests and doors and disable most traps.

**[Spoiler warning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_warning): *Plot and/or ending details follow.***

In the original campaign, Tomi gives the player his ring for completing his quests. These quests involve retrieving specific items, like:

* Chapter 1: Official document (found on a bookcase in Thomas' Wheelwright's repair shop, in south-eastern part of [Beggar&#39;s Nest](https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Beggar%27s_Nest "Beggar's Nest"))
* Chapter 2: The Star of Calimshan (found in a chest in central part of Wanev's tower Level 1)
* Chapter 3: Ashes of the Running Wolf (found in an urn in northern part (near Uthgardt worshippers) near Fort Illkard).
