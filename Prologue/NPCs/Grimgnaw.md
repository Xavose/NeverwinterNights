**Description:** A cold and remorseless killer, Grimgnaw left his dwarven clan behind long ago to join the monastic order of the Long Death. Like all monks of this [evil](https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Evil "Evil") order he reveres death, suffering, and all things gruesome and macabre.

Grimgnaw is always eager to deliver new victims into the grasp of Death, the Silent Lord. Despite his fixation on death, he is disgusted by the carnage of the Wailing Death, which he disdains as not allowing its victims a "true" death.

Grimgnaw is a very tough character, being (mostly) offensive in combat, performing [stunning fists](https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Stunning_fist "Stunning fist").
