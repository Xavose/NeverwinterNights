Here, Herban and Erdan put the characters to the test in terms of martial proficiency.

# Melee Weapon Proficiency:

Each character will have a chance to make three attacks at Herban with whatever melee weapon they would like to use. If the character has no melee weapons they can grab any of the real weapons on display within the training hall. If the character is successful in striking Herban he will even allow them to keep the weapon.

Herban is a level 3 fighter wearing a chain shirt and wielding a shield and longsword. His **AC is 19** and he is taking the **dodge action**, which gives all attacks against him disadvantage. Herban will grant any character who atempts to gain some for of advantage over him a + or even a higher rank, while those who disadvantage themselves or do not take any actions to improve their odds a lower mark.

Any creature who strikes Herban once recieves a B rank, twice A rank, thrice S rank. All other's recieve a C or D rank based on their performance.

# Ranged Weapon Proficiency:

Erdan has an advanced archery range available for characters to prove their marksman capabilities.

Characters will have three targets appear in front of them all at once and they will need to identify and shoot the correct target before they then drop down. 

1. A grizley bear, a goblin, and a little girl
   1. If the character makes an insight check they can discern that both the goblin and the bear appear to be runniing from the little girl. That is because she is in fact a wight that is spreading its undeath.
