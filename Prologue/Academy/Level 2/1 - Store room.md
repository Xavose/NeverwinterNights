When you enter this room, you'll confront another mysterious mage, who will conjure in a couple more Weak Goblins and send them at you. Once you've dispatched of them, search the chest in the northeast corner to find a magical item suitable to your class (such as a [Ring of Fortitude +1](https://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/nwnwalkthrough/academytraining2.php#null) or [Boots of Reflexes +1](https://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/nwnwalkthrough/academytraining2.php#null)). In addition to the magic item, you can find three [Potions of Cure Light Wounds](https://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/nwnwalkthrough/academytraining2.php#null) in another chest along the east wall.
