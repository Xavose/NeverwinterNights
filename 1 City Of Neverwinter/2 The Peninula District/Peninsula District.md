Once the fight is over **Captain** **Kalgarat** will thank the party for their timely assistance. He is happy to inform the party of the following facts:

- Two nights ago their was a riot in the prison that could be heard within the city streets. After the riot ended, prisoners began taking to the streets in organized raid groups.
- The players need to find a way to get into the prison and figure out what is going on.
- The captain also asks them to help investigate either the sewers or the tanglebrook estate
  - Sewers: The escaped prisoners seem to have created a base of operations there. Captain Kalgarat does not like the smell of it.
  - Tanglebrook Estate: Reports say that undead creatures are roaming the tangle brook estate, find out what is going on and save lady tanglebrook if possible. She is a linch pinn of the Peninsula District.

Further more, if the escaped sorcerer is allowed ot live and interogated the party can succeed on a DC 15 CHA check to learn the following information.

- Two nights ago the head jailor started freeing all the prisoners and had them execute all the prison guards
- Since then he has been held up in the deepest parts of the prison and only a select few have been allowed to meet with him
- The head Jailor sent this group out to break into the heart of Neverwinter
- **If the conversation lasts long enough, the head jailor will reach into the escaped prisoners mind and threaten the party if they do not leave the city of neverwinter to him.**

## Random Encounters in the District

### Desicrated Corpse

```
Lying on the ground in a pool of blood you see a face down corpse. 
```

This is the corpse of the first victim the **Intellect Devourer**. When it ran into **Jiargal**, Lady Tanglebrooks butler, it ripped from this poor soul and latched onto the butler.

### Downed Wagon

```
Turning the corner you see a large wagon turned up on it's side. Attop the wagon is a small gnome farmer with a cross bow yelling <Irish Accent> "Get back ye' filthy dogs!" before he looses a bolt at a nearing prisoner. Behind him, you see a halfling woman holding a torch and waiving it violently down at the approaching vagabonds. As the farmer goes to reload, the other prisoners see an opportunity and attack!
```

**Marrlon** and his wife **Karla**, were attempting to flea the Peninsula district after the prison break. They brought their servant, **Garrosh** who is currently getting supplies to fix the Wagon.

Their Wagon broke down in the middle of the streets (It was initially salvaged from parts). **Marrlon** will offer the party 50gp if they can track down Garrosh and bring him back with the wagon supplies from **Targod's Wood Wove's**.

### Cult Assassin

https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounters/b367be9c-9c5b-4a1d-b970-29ac52974bdf

```
Up ahead you see the remnants of a sprawling district market outlined by flickering red and orange light. The thick aroma of cooked meat and char accompanies the scene. The market is a hodgepodge maze of tents, canopies, and stands that alude to a once bustleing town square. But in the wake of the Wailing Death whatever social corner this once was is now abandoned and ransacked. 

Through the maze of tents you can just make out a giant pyre alit by a blaze. The source of the flickering light and ostensibly the cooked meat. 

==========================================================

As you pass by the thicket of tents and stands you hear a creeking noise like the opening of a large hinge.

==========================================================

If the player's inspect the tents they must succeed on a DC 25 Investigation / Perception check or be surprised by the assassin lurking within. 
```

If the players inspect the assassins corpse they find only a tattered note that says

```
Follow your adversaries into the Peninsula district and put an end to their efforts. 
~ SoO
```

### Priest of Helm

```
Accross the street you see the familiar figure of a priest of helm. He holds his head high and appears a paragon of virtue among the dingy and pillaged city streets.
```

Paldriar is a fledgling false priest of Helm. He will happily give his blessing to the party which lasts until the party finishes a long rest but gives them a -5 penalty to their next wailing death check.

# Sewer Entrance

The bandit leader has a set of keys to the prison gate on him. 

# Tanglebrook Estate

Use chicken pizza map: VampireMansion

The mind flayer infected a twisted and powerful necromancer with one of it's spawn. However, the necromancer managed to weaken the creature just prior to it taking over his mind. As a result, a shard of his mind still remians, though twisted and altered.
