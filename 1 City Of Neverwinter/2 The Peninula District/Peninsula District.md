## Random Encounters in the District

### Desicrated Corpse

```
Lying on the ground in a pool of blood you see a face down corpse. 
```

This is the corpse of the first victim the **Intellect Devourer**. When it ran into **Jiargal**, Lady Tanglebrooks butler, it ripped from this poor soul and latched onto the butler.

### Downed Wagon

```
Turning the corner you see a large wagon turned up on it's side. Attop the wagon is a small gnome farmer with a cross bow yelling <Irish Accent> "Get back ye' filthy dogs!" before he looses a bolt at a nearing prisoner. Behind him, you see a halfling woman holding a torch and waiving it violently down at the approaching vagabonds. As the farmer goes to reload, the other prisoners see an opportunity and attack!
```

**Marrlon** and his wife **Karla**, were attempting to flea the Peninsula district after the prison break. They brought their servant, **Garrosh** who is currently getting supplies to fix the Wagon.

Their Wagon broke down in the middle of the streets (It was initially salvaged from parts). **Marrlon** will offer the party 50gp if they can track down Garrosh and bring him back with the wagon supplies.

### Priest of Helm

```
Accross the street you see the familiar figure of a priest of helm. He holds his head high and appears a paragon of virtue among the dingy and pillaged city streets.
```

Paldriar is a fledgling false priest of Helm. He will happily give his blessing to the party which lasts until the party finishes a long rest but gives them a -5 penalty to their next wailing death check.
