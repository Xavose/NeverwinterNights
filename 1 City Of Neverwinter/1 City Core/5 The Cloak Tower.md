# From Game

The Cloaktower is home to **Eltoora Sarptyl**, leader of the **Many-Starred Cloak** guild. If you are a Sorcerer or Wizard (nope, no persuasion checks on this one), you can offer to join the guild. She will ask that you bring her a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood from the arcane laboratories of the Many-Starred Cloak located throughout Neverwinter. She will then tell you that each lab is marked with a sundial and give you a key to enter them. In addition, she will also sell various magic items, including mage robes and quite a few spell scrolls.

Begin the Many Starred Cloak trials- Players must visit four wizard labs spread throughout the city. Each lab has a teleporation circle that will transport the party to an arcane sanctum that will have a trial that the characters will need to complete. The trials will be related to the 8 shools of magic. Each trial will test the players on two of the schools of magic each.
