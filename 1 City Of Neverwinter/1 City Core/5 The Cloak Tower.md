# From Game

The Cloaktower is home to **Eltoora Sarptyl**, leader of the **Many-Starred Cloak** guild. If you are a Sorcerer or Wizard (nope, no persuasion checks on this one), you can offer to join the guild. She will ask that you bring her a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood from the arcane laboratories of the Many-Starred Cloak located throughout Neverwinter. She will then tell you that each lab is marked with a sundial and give you a key to enter them. In addition, she will also sell various magic items, including mage robes and quite a few spell scrolls.

Becoming a member of the Many Starred Cloak Enclave

```
Our guild is always looking for new members, but at the moment we are fully booked up. We used to have more room to stretch our legs, but ever since we lost access to the wizard towers in each of the sub districts, we have had to limit our numbers quite a bit. 

Most of our members are warry of wading through the other districts to relink the auxillery towers to the cloak tower. If you could however go to each of these towers when Lady Aribeth sends you to these districts, we can give you a device that will create a portal between the host tower and the auxillery towers. 

At each tower you will have to go through the static portal to the inner sanctum. These sanctums are each guarded by arcane golems that will attack you on sight. Master Gnolem who died early on to the plague. He had command words for each golem that would pacify them, if you can figure out which command word pairs to each Golem then it will become pacified. Once you have circumvented the Golem, use the device and it will create a portal between the Host tower and Auxillery tower. 

For each tower you reconnect to the main tower I can offer you one item enchanted by our guild. After you connect the first tower we will also be happy to accept you as guild accolytes, giving you access to our preliminary benefits.
