After fleeing the Academy you watched as flames consumed the once proud walls. Torching them black with soot and collapsing many of the interior structures through the intense heat.  

New quickly spreads throught the city that the cure that had almost been in sight was now lost. Even more crushing were the deaths of so many hopeful adventurers at this surprise enemy attack. 

And yet, a bead of hope remains within the hearts of the citizens. For news spreads of a small group of adventurers who ventured into the enemies trap and emerged unsacthed with proof of their enemies defeat. To that end, your party has been invited to meet at the Temple of Tyr in one weeks time to be publicly rewarded for your feats of bravery in the face of such terrible odds. 

Enraged at the plot against her people, Lady Aribeth has publicly sworn to bring whatever group was behind these attacks to justice as well as recapture the waterdavian creatures.

As you await your accolades you have some time to rest and recoup. Shortly after the events at the Academy end Fenthick Moss tracks you down to give you 500 gp as a reward for helping defeat the enemy. He departed wishing you all well and requesting that you stay in the city at least long enough to accept Lord Nasher's gratitude and blessing at the end of the week.
