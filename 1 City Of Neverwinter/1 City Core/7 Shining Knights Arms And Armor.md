To stock up on weapons and armor (including many magical ones), you'll want to pay a visit to Durga's shop here in the southern part of the City Core. If you are a warrior-type (or if you make a successful persuasion check), Durga will give you a ward stone that will allow you into the back room where you can have a dwarf named Marrok forge very powerful weapons and armor.

Marrok will give you a list of what items he can forge and what ingredients are required to do so.
