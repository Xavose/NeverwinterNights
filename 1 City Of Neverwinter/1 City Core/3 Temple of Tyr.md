**1 - FENTHICK & DESTHER**

You will begin Chapter One in the temple's Sanatorium, amid several citizens infected with the Wailing Death. Fenthick will strike up a conversation with you while Desther proclaims his distaste with Lady Aribeth's decision to choose you. Towards the end of the conversation, Fenthick will tell you to meet with Lady Aribeth, who waits for you just beyond the north door.

During your search for the Waterdhavian creatures you will be attacked by some mysterious assassins each time you reclaim one of the ingredients. Keep your eyes open for the notes because they contain information that might shed some light on the strange Plague and the attack on the Academy. Fenthick will be in charge of uncovering the enemy behind the plague so it would be wise to return these notes back to him.

There are four of these notes and each time you return one back to Fenthick you will be rewarded with 50 experience points and 300 gold pieces. You can also earn another 50 gold pieces with a successful persuasion check. Additional after returning the fourth and last note you should learn for the first time that a strange cult called the Cult of the Eye might be behind the attack on the Academy and the plague.

**2 - LADY ARIBETH**

Once again, you'll meet with Lady Aribeth. She will tell you that she has been following your progress at the Academy for quite some time, and could use your help. You are asked to find the Waterdhavian creatures, return them to her, and then discover who was behind the attack on the Academy. When you have accepted the task, Lady Aribeth will give you the Stone of Recall, which you can use at any time during the game to return to the Temple of Tyr. Additionally, she will give you 100 gold pieces and allow you to purchase gear from her (including many magical items).

Below you can see where you can get each ingredient for the cure:

 **1st � Devourer Brain** : Found deep into the prison and into the Lair of the Devourer after defeating both Head Gaoler and intellect Devourer. Return the brain to Aribeth and you will be rewarded with 150 experience point and 500 gold pieces. If you choose not to accept the reward you will earn a sum of 10 points alignment shift towards good.

 **2nd � Heart of a Yuan-Ti** : Found at the Warrens of the Damned below Beggars Nest after defeating the Yuan-Ti Gulnan who was causing the undead infestation at the District. Return the heart to Aribeth and you will be rewarded with 150 experience point and 500 gold pieces. If you choose not to accept the reward you will earn a sum of 10 points alignment shift towards good.

 **3rd � Cockatrice Feather** : Found at the sewers of the Dock District after defeating Callik and uncovering the scheme of Vengaul on Lord Nasher. Return the cockatrice to Aribeth and you will be rewarded with 150 experience point and 500 gold pieces. If you choose not to accept the reward you will earn a sum of 10 points alignment shift towards good.

 **4th � Lock of Nymph's Lair** : Found inside Meldanen's Estate after defeating Meldanen and freeing the Dryad in his sanctum. Return the lock of lair to Aribeth and you will be rewarded with 150 experience point and 500 gold pieces. If you choose not to accept the reward you will earn a sum of 10 points alignment shift towards good.

When all the ingredients are gathered, Lady Aribeth will let you know that they are now ready to perform the ritual to create the cure and for your efforts you will be allowed to be present when the ritual will conduct. Once you go to the ritual chamber though you cannot get back to the city's areas so don't forget to settle any loose ends you have before leaving.

**3 - SERGOL AND THE TELEPORTATION PORTAL**

Here you'll find the Recall Portal that is tied to the Stone of Recall in your backpack. Whenever you use the Stone, it will instantly teleport you to this spot so that you can buy more supplies and rest up. In control of the portal is a man named Sergol, who can teach you how to use the Stone if you are new to the game. Keep in mind that in order to go back to where you teleported from, you must spend 50 gold pieces. Along the eastern wall is the Divining Pool, which will recover any lost relics for a price.

**4 - EXIT TO OLEFF'S CHAMBER**

This door leads to the chamber of Oleff, Reverend Judge of Tyr.

**5 - TOMI UNDERGALLOWS**

Tomi Undergallows is a halfling-for-hire near the door that leads out to the City Core. If you need the assistance of a rogue, you may want to hire him for the 200 gold pieces he asks for (or 150, if you make a successful persuasion check).

**6 - OLEFF**

This area is the apse of Reverand Judge Oleff, who will tell you that the temple is currently administering to the plague sufferers. He'll also mention that they were previously working on recovering an artifact, and if you are a cleric or druid (or make successful persuasion check) he will ask for your help. He'll explain that they have recently found evidence that may lead them to the tomb of Halueth Never, founder of Neverwinter. You must take a letter to Briley in the Peninsula District, who guards one of the tombs they've already found.

If you have talked will Ophala at the Moonstone Mask you will need to return here and show him the letter of Ophala in order to get permission to go upstairs at the Moonstone Mask and meet up with the girls there.

Below you can find all the locations of all the artifacts found at the various Never Tombs around the city.

 **Jacob's Blessed Quill** : The Quill in no longer in a never tomb but in the possession of Gilles that he is located at the Moonstone Mask. You can choose to take the evil path and return the artifacts you find to him instead of Oleff or threaten Gilles to give you the item. Return the artifact back Oleff and you will be rewarded with 500 gold pieces and 3 points alignment shift towards good.

 **Ancient Chronicles of Halueth Never** : Found inside the Never Tomb at the Great Cemetery. Return the artifact back Oleff and you will be rewarded with 500 gold pieces and 3 points alignment shift towards good.

 **Ancient Symbol of Tyr** : Found inside the Never Tomb at the Docks Aqueducts. Return the artifact back Oleff and you will be rewarded with 500 gold pieces and 3 points alignment shift towards good.

 **Halueth's Rusted Armor** : Found inside the Never Tomb which is located under a house at the Blacklake district. Return the artifact back Oleff and you will be rewarded with 500 gold pieces and 3 points alignment shift towards good.

When the last artifact is given back to Oleff you will also be rewarded with 200 experience points and your alignment will be shifted another 3 points towards good. Oleff will also give you an Amulet, the Amulet of Will +3. This is also one of the times that you must persuade Oleff for something more. With a successful persuasion check you will earn an Adamantine Stone as well.
