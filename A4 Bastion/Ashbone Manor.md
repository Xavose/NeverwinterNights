## Gazlem

Goblin artificer who designed the Artifice Inteligence Castle

## Castle

An Artifice Intelligence tied to the Ashbone Manor. The Artifice powering Castle is contained within the walls of Ashbone Manor, as the Manor grows, so too does Castle. 

Castle is designed to act as a butler for the heads of Ashbone Manor. She is able to cast most non combat cantrips and several non combat first and second level spells to assist in her Butler duties. Castle can also project her image anywhere within Ashbone Manor using arcane foci hidden throughout its walls. 

Castle is loyal only to the heads of Asbone Manor, but will also help any other guests or denizens of the manor so long as they act justly towards her masters.
