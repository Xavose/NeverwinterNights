# **COMMON ITEMS**

Potion of climbing: Giant spider silk.
Potion of healing: As per the rules, potions of healing (all types) can be created without exotic ingredients. But it might be fun to seed the world with exotic healing herbs, which reduce the cost of creating healing potions.
Spell scroll: As per the rules, spell scrolls can be made without exotic ingredients. But if you harvest some giant octopus or squid ink, I’d let you make scrolls at a discount.
Other common magic items: Xanathar’s Guide has a bunch of common magic items, all weak enough that they probably shouldn’t require a special ingredient to make.
