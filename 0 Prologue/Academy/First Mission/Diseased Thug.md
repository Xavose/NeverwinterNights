News that a raving mad man is attacking the Shining Knights Arms and Armor reaches the academy's ears.

There is a lot of nerves and need to do well on this first mission to show the citizens of neverwinter that the new Adventurers can perform well and handle the situation. 

Lady Aribeth calls upon the characters to serve and warns them that they need to take care of the situation professionaly. 

```
As you move through the narrow streats of Neverwinter you see up ahead two figures shambling towards you. One is a large half orc in his fourth decade. He is currently helping a middle aged dwarf stumble along the cobble stone. The dwarf is clearly favoring his right leg and you can see blood dripping down his left. 
```

On route to the Shining Knight's the character's will run into Durga and Murrok (the vendor and blackmsith of Shining Knights). Murrok is clearly favoring his right leg and if the players inquire they can discern that Murrok was attacked by the dieased thug. By talking to the two the party can discern that the mad man is a Diseased Thug, use [Chardalyn Berserker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1123070-chardalyn-berserker) stat block. 

When the character's arrive at the shining knight's

```
Through the thick wooden doors you hear through thick oak doors the sounds of clanking and incoharant moaning. You open the doors and see a large room containing several shelves of mundane weapons and armor. Several shelves have been upended, their contents strews across the wooden floor. You hear the sounds of clattering and look further in to see a pale man hunched over a piece of leather armor mumbling and raving words you do not recognize. 
```

If the character's are careful they can get the jump on the thug who is mostly distracted chewing on leather he thinks is a fine steak meal. However, if the characters are noticed in any way the thug attacks with his spiked club. 

## Combat Notes: 

Any character who fails their save against the thugs poison also gains +1 to the DC of their next wailing death save. 

## After combat notes

When the players have succesfully dealt with the thug they have a number of options.

If they choose to loot the building they can aqquire pretty much any type of non magical weapons and armor, however Durga will suspect them of this, and not level of peruasion will convince him that the players were not some how responsible. 

If the players leave the armory alone (or better yet lock it up when they are done) they can earn bonus renwon with the shining knight's. 

The character's are free to return back to the Academy and update Aribeth on their exploits. Aribeth will reward each of them 50 gp and a healing potion.
