# The Academy Burns

When the players return from their first quest they see smoke rising from the academy windows and doors.

When they make it to the Academy

```
Bodies of your fellow adventurers litter the courtyard and pillars of smoke stream out of doors and windows leading into the Academy. The scene ahead is of battle as a scant few survivors fight off scattered groups of skeletons and goblins. You can see that many of the members of the senior barracks have joined in this fight. Daelen and Tommi take down a pair of goblins each with their swift weapons while Grimgnaw laghs maniachly as he punches skeletons into bone pile. Linu darts between the corpse strewn battlefield rendering what litle aid she can while avoiding the battle at large. 
```

When the characters reach the battle let them join in for a couple of rounds before Lady Aribeth appears.

Aribeth uses turn unded to destroy a horde of skeletons

Aribeth walks towards the characters and asks them for help

```
Please we must act quickly. I fear the forces attacking the Academy must be after the waterdavian creatures. We may already be too late.
```

- Aribethe will hapily tell the group that she, fenthick, and Desther were speaking with some of the newer recruits when a group of mages suddenly appeared and attack. She and her comrades fought back the intruders but at great cost. Aribeth then went to clear a path out for the other survivors while Fenthick and Desther went to secure the waterdavian creatures.
- The waterdavian creatures are four magical creatures who will  be used to create the cure for the wailing death.
- The waterdavian creatures are being held in stalls in the Academy underground. They include an Umbral Hulk (pinver),  Oblex (brain), a Couatl (feather), a dryad (hair), and a Yuan-ti (scale).

Aribeth emplores the players to track down the intruders and keep the waterdavian creatures safe. Before they depart she will take out a stone of restoration and grant them the effects of a long rest. She also gives each player 2 regular healing potions.
