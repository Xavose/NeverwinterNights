Continuing on the mysteroius mage's train the players find themselved in a small alchemy lab. The goblins have already been through here, and several gobin corpses litter the floor with a single cloaked body covered in blood.

Investigating the scene the players will be able to discern that the alchemist must have killed the goblins in the room before surcoming to the others.

The room has already been mostly looted, but if the players want to spend a minute investigating they can make a DC 13 Investigation check to find the following items.

Potion of Healing: 2

Alchemist Flask: 1

Acid Flask: 1

Holy Water: 1

Oil Flask: 1

Thunderstone (custom) 15 ft radius, DC 13 CON or Blind and Deaf for 1d4 rounds.

Smoke Bomb: Throwing the bomb essentially creates the Fog spell in a 15 foot radius.
