# Summary

The rogue training involves trying to get three golden coins from any of five different sources.

## In my pocket

The first of the coins is actually inside of rogue master Ketta's pocket. There is not specific way the player is expected to retrieve this coin. But Ketta plans to hand it out to a candidate who especially impresses her. 

## In the bouncer's pocket

Graul, a half orc rogue, holds another coin. He stands alone in a well lit room surrounded by various boxes, walls, and pillars. There is also is straight line path to Graul that avoids any obstacles.

If the player tries to skeak up to and pick Graul's pocket they must make a stealth check. To maintain stealth they will have to move between at least three different pieces of cover. To move to safe cover the PC will need to make scaling perception or investigation checks (DC 5, 10, 15) to find safe cover. If the PC fails they move onto a trapped piece of cover in which case they must make a new stealth roll as they try to maintain their stealth. 

## At the top of a really tall room.

The next coin floats at the top of a 20 foot tall pillar. The pillar is 1 foot by 1 foot and has walls 5 feet from it in all directions. 

Players are expected to use acrobatics to scale the sides of the pillar to retrieve the coin
