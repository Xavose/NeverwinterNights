# Summary

In these trials the Player is presented with a table of arcane tools and 9 walls representing different schools of magic. Behind each wall is a feather and the players must obtain 4 feather's in total to succeed.

If a character wishes to make an Arcana check to determine things about the test the follwing DCs apply

To Determine Spell at play (These DCs are reduced by 5 if the player can cast that level of spell and an additional 5 if that spell is on their available spell list)

- Cantrip: DC 5
- 1st level spell: DC 8
- 2nd level spell: DC 11
- 3rd level spell: DC 14
- 4th level spell: DC 17
- 5th level spell: DC 20
- 6th level spell: DC 23

If the player beats the DC by 5 or more they can also discover which wand they are expected to use against this wall.

If the player fails the DC but fails by less than 5 they can at least discern the school of spell in play.
