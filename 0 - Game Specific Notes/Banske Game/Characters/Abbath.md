  - Why in Neverwinter:
    - Been traveling along the sword coast and made friends in Waterdeep
    - Hoping he can forge a new path
  - I discovered that my one true love, Constance, fell in love with my best friend, Jappa. This of course greatly upset me, so I decided to set a booby trap at a local gathering place. After I heard that the booby trap had been tripped, I investigated the result, only to discover that not only had it caused the death of Constance and Jappa, but also the deaths of my two daughters, Coraline and Frida. In a fit of rage I crushed the shells of Constance and Jappa, set a fire and burned the (shell-less) bodies of my wife and former best friend, as well as the bodies of my daughters. I then knew that I had to come to terms with my anger and hatred and had to do better by the world and help those in need. So I left, to travel and find myself on my own.
