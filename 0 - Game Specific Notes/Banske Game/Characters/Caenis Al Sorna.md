Members of the flaming fists are free to hire themselves out to external organizations as long as that organization isn't against the flaming fists or Baldur's gate. Caenis also isn't like a foot soldier in the flaming fist more so like an officer equivalent. while still relatively young in the group, he has future hopes of rising in merit and position to become a chief military counselor of either Baldur's Gate or maybe the lords alliance (that is far in the future so he isn't sure yet) but he takes up gigs to help build his connections and becoming a more proven leader.

The flaming fist is well aware he is in Neverwinter aiding the city and academy. They don't mind him gaining personal renown and renown for the organization having their members reflect well. If they have some tasks for him to do while there, that isn't an issue for him at all and he would welcome the chance to help the flaming fist more.

Basically to answer your question, the flaming fist didn't send him, he volunteered to go on his own. They are okay with it, may have some things for him to do while there, but nothing he knows of yet. When he returns to Baldur's Gate, he will still have his position in the Flaming Fists. Caenis is hopeful that he can build upon his success and use that to get into higher positions within the flaming fist or Baldur's gate for now
