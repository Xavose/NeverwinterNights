My mother, **Helen**, was a human cleric of Helm and a member of the Watchers over the Fallen. During a battle she was captured and taken prisoner by worshipers of Bhaal. They kept her as a prisoner and tortured her for information about the Helmite positions and fortresses. She remained resolute and devoted to Helm throughout and eventually her prayers were answered when she was saved by a Movanic Deva, **Selephon**, sent by Helm. They fell in love and she became pregnant with me. I was raised in the Helm's hold. Because Aasimar children were highly discouraged and seen as a sin against Helm they were rare. I was met with resentment by many for my divine lineage and put on a pedestal by many others in my community. Because of this I was kept away from many of the others in the community who were trained as Clerics and Paladins and was instead taught how to channel my power into many things beyond what my mother could teach me as a cleric. I eventually left because it was clear to me that others would not be able to get past my lineage and treat me the same as everyone else for better or worse.

I came to Neverwinter in the hope of honoring Helm while outrunning the stings of my lineage. I secretly hope that one day I may gain Helm's favor and be allowed into his direct service as a full powered angel. I do my best to stay out of the spotlight directly. I look human in appearance with blonde hair and blue eyes. I wear large flowing robes with a large hood that hangs down over my back to disguise and cover the feathered wings that remain tightly pressed to my back.

## Worship of a dead god

Unkown to mortals, Helm was slain by Tyr in a misunderstanding perpetuated by Cyric (the god of trickery). In the wake of Helm's death, one of his Devas, **Selephon**, was sent to the material plane with orders of birthing a savior to the priesthood of Helm. Selephon found Helen and knew her to bear a soul devoted to protection and defense. He blessed her with a child, **Gariel**.

Unknown to the other gods, Helms death was orcestrated by Morag who feared Helm's intervention in her plans for Neverwinter. With the fall of Helm, Morag was able to implace Desther within the folds of the Helmites and bring about his meteoric rise to power within the Hold. When Desther had risen to sufficient glory, he turned on his fellow Helmites, slaughtering them all and raising up his own priests and devotees sworn to the Creator Race.

When Helen began to sense mounting tensions and deceipt within Helm's Hold she fled with her baby to **Waterdeep**. There, unwiling to accept the destiney that had been placed on her child's shoulder's Helen did her best to raise Gariel without the knowledge of his destiney. To her dismay, when Gariel was still a young boy he began to show signs of innate divine magic on a level that she had never born wintess to before. Still she tried to protect her baby boy from his detiney. But, as Gariel grew older a natural curiosity setled upon him to find out more about his past and his connection to Helm.

It is now Gariel's destiney to decide the fate of Helm's future within the Forgotten Realms. First, he must learn of Helm's absence and demise. Then, he must fell those who have corrupted his god's will on Toril. Finally, when the corruption has been cut away, he will have to decide how to move forward in worship to a broken and dead god.

## Discovering the false Helmites

With the aid of Fenthic, Desther has bestowed a ring of protection onto some of the key figures within Neverwinter. Lady Aribeth, Lord Nasher, and many of the council all wear these rings. The rings were blessed by Desther to fend off the wailing death, but they also give Desther a path to influence the minds of those wearing his rings. Noteably, Desther saw no need to bestow a ring on Fenthic who trust Desther implicitly because Desther once falsly saved the life of Fenthic's nephew.

## Figuring out what happened to Helm

Nearly all of the power that remains from Helm now rests within Gariel. Much of this power is locked behind magical barriers placed within Gariel. Ready to be unleashed as his own personal knowledge and power grows.

## Antagonists

### Desther Leader of the False Helmites

### Cyric God of Deception

Cyric's original involvement in this plot was founded in the Trickster's desire to steal Helm's power. When Helm realized his demise was imminant he sequestered that power away within Tyr. That power is now bonded to Tyr and can only be fully released once Tyr chooses to release it.

Cyric now waits in the shadows for the moment where he can strike and take Helm's power for himself. In the meantime, he has taken Helm's place in most of the Protector God's area's of worship. In these cases, he creates false and twisted protection for those who offer worship.

If Cyric does get his hands on Helm's portfolio he plans to

## You are on a Path

You are on a road. One path leads to skys of grey, another leads to sky's of blue, one path more still leads to sky's of gold. Which path will you choose.

### The grey path

Two figures stand in the path. One an elderly man with beard of grey and a severed hand, the other cloaked in shadows of black. The cloaked figure holds an orb

The orb shows vissions of a heavily armored man with golden gauntlets holding hands with a fair red headed maiden. 

As the grey haired man looks upon the orb, his eyes fill with rage

### The blue bath

Two figures stand in the path. One armored with golden gauntlets, the other an elderly man with beard of gret and a severed hand. The two stand arguing, their voices muted but gestures loud. The Grey haried man rages, the armored man placates. A sword appears, the grey haired man strikes down the armored one. As he dies, golden light leaves the armored man and flows into the grey haired one. 

### The gold path

A figure lies in the path. Armor broken and golden gauntlets cracked. Behind the lying armor are shadows and clouds of grey. As you approach the armor quakes, but does not stir. A raspy voice spills forth "I guard this path! Do not approach. This way is forbidden".
