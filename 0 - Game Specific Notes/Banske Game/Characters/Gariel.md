My mother, **Helen**, was a human cleric of Helm and a member of the Watchers over the Fallen. During a battle she was captured and taken prisoner by worshipers of Bhaal. They kept her as a prisoner and tortured her for information about the Helmite positions and fortresses. She remained resolute and devoted to Helm throughout and eventually her prayers were answered when she was saved by a Movanic Deva, **Selephon**, sent by Helm. They fell in love and she became pregnant with me. I was raised in the Helm's hold. Because Aasimar children were highly discouraged and seen as a sin against Helm they were rare. I was met with resentment by many for my divine lineage and put on a pedestal by many others in my community. Because of this I was kept away from many of the others in the community who were trained as Clerics and Paladins and was instead taught how to channel my power into many things beyond what my mother could teach me as a cleric. I eventually left because it was clear to me that others would not be able to get past my lineage and treat me the same as everyone else for better or worse.

I came to Neverwinter in the hope of honoring Helm while outrunning the stings of my lineage. I secretly hope that one day I may gain Helm's favor and be allowed into his direct service as a full powered angel. I do my best to stay out of the spotlight directly. I look human in appearance with blonde hair and blue eyes. I wear large flowing robes with a large hood that hangs down over my back to disguise and cover the feathered wings that remain tightly pressed to my back.
