## Zakya Rakshasa: CR 5

Component: Eye

Location: Black Lake district

Notes: 

- Guilferar Backhand, is actually a Zakya Rakshasa in disguise. He arrived in the black lake district 2 years after the plague began and immediately found the quint district to his utmost satisfaction. He set up shop in the district and sells exotic merchandise and magic items to the nobility, using what little alchemy and enchanting he knows to fool the nobles into believing his wares provide magical protection against the wailing death.
- Unfortunately for Guilferar, the cloaked enclave used powerful scrying magic to locate a nearby rakshasa eye when they learned it was needed for the cure. Guilferar was surprised to find the spellcasters at his doorstep. After some quick thinking and using some of his arcane tools Guilferar managed to convince the guild he had a rakshasa eye on hand and gave them one of his own eyes.
- Now that the previous eye has been lost, the cloak tower will tell the city guard to go inquire with Guilferar about where he got the previous eye from. Guilferar is ready this time, and he plans to take the adventurers into the Never's tomb and lock them inside for good.
