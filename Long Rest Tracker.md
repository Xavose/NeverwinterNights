# Wailing Death Rules:

Until the party thwarts Desther and the Other Priests of Helm they are at risk of contracting the wailing death.

Unknown to the denizens of Neverwinter, the wailing death is no plague at all, but rather a mix of various diseases that have been exasterbated by the false priests of helm emparting their false blessing on the townsfolk. With each blessing, the priests are actually surpressing the recievers immune system and allowing all sorts of diseases to take hold.

At the end of each long rest the players take while within the walls of Neverwinter they myst succeed on a Constitution savingthrow. The DC for this check is set according to the following conditions.

- Base DC: 6
- +2 if the player was blessed by a priest of helm since their last long rest.
- +2 if the player spent time in a quarantined area since their last long rest.
- +2 if the character was in close contact with someone infected by the diseas.
- +2 for each level of the wailing death the player has surcomb to.

Succeeding this DC by ten or more reduces the characters wailing death level by one stage.

Failing this DC causes the character to gain one level of wailing death

Failing this DC by ten causes the character to gain two level of wailing death

Each time a player gains a level of wailing death they must roll on the wailing death table to determin what effect has been added to their diseas.
