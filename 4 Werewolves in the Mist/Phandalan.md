# Harbin Wester, Quest Giver

```
The townmaster’s hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell tower at the back. The job board next to the front door features a sparse number of notices, all written in Common and in the same hand.
```

All the notices on the job board are written by Harbin Wester, Phandalin's duly appointed townmaster. Harbin is a pompous, middle-aged banker who lives in a house east of the townmaster's hall. Reports of a werewolves in the area have turned him into a veritable shut-in, and he rarely goes outside except to get food and post new notices calling for adventurers.

Characters who knock on Harbin’s door hear his voice on the other side say,

```
“If you’re a werwolf, know that I’m far too thin and bony to make a good meal!"
```

 No matter what the adventurers do to allay his fears, Harbin refuses to open the door, preferring to talk through it. Other residents who trouble Harbin with complaints receive similar treatment.

If the characters ask him about a quest, Harbin sets them on the right track, offering payment upon their return. When the time comes to pay up, he slips the payment under the door one gold coin at a time

# Shrine of Luck (Harpers)

Phandalin’s only temple is a shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora (goddess of luck and good fortune) and is normally in the care of a zealous elf acolyte named Sister Garaele.

**Sister Garaele** is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land to thwart tyrants. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin. If she learns of the Character's Plans she will help them aquire silvered weapons and a scroll of remove curse. 

# Rumors to be heard

* The werewolf pack has almost a dozen members. The leader of the pack is a man named Kiril.
* The werewolves come from a distant land called Barovia. The Lords’ Alliance has no information about it.
* The werewolves worship a deity called Mother Night.
* The werewolves leave and return to Barovia through some kind of ancient portal. (This is a deduction on Eravien’s part, based on the werewolf prisoner’s vague description of how the pack gets to and from Barovia.)
