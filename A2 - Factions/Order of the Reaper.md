# Brief

In years gone, the order of the reaper worked in the open. Publically routing out evil and restoring balance as needed. But their power and renoun grew to heights that could not withstand the influence of coruption. 

In just a few generations the proud order fell to the control of those who wielded it for monitary, political, on powerful wealth. Their power was such that a coalition of churches under many of the gods (rumored to have been joined by the reaper himself) had to come together to rout out the evil. 

Today, the order of the reaper has changed drastically. Publically, the order was completely routed out and destroyed. Secretly however, the order operates under the same tenant as before, **do what needs to be done**. Their means have changed though. Where they used to strike in the day, they now strike at night, if they even strike at all. And their centralized form of governing has now been broken down into a few trusted agents that act individually to rout out the evil that threatens to unbalance the world. 

# Operations

**A job worth doing is worth doing well, and in order to do a job well you must find someone who believes the job is worth doing.** 

This is the new guiding principle behind the orders new organization. Behind the scenes, agents who have been loyal to the order their entire lives work to find those who already find a job worth their time and poiint them in the right direction. At times, those jobs are to protect, other times the job calls for blood. To the order it matters not, they seek only to maintain the veil between life and death.
