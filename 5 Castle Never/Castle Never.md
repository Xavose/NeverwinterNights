# Powers at Play

## Nurvureem (Dark Lady) Shadow Dragon

Since her escape, Nurvureem has taken root in the highest towers of Castle Never. There, she wages a war against the haunting souls of Lord Haleuth Never's court.

### Motivations

Nurvureem wants the treasure, bones, and spirits that reside within Castle Never so that she can turn the castle into her new base of power. She has little regard for the denizens of Neverwinter, after all, a lion does not mind the ants that burrow outside its cave.

If the party wants to side with Nurvureem she will require they complete the following Objectives: 

- Bring her the treasure locked inside the vaults on the second floor (R23)
  - The chests are trapped with powerful magic
- Bring her old man bellows so that she can use him to gain greater controll over the castle
- Rid the Noble Spyre and Arcanist Spyre of their pests

### Minions

Nurvureem controls many raised shadows as well as two lieutenants.

#### Nardor (The Apprentice)

Nardor is a young black dragon on it's way to becoming a shadow dragon. Nurvureem is teaching him dark secrets in exchange for his services taking over Castle Never

#### Ursa (The Flesh Offering)

Ursa is a Goblin Wizard skilled in the arts of conjuration. Ursa has been summoning creatures from outside the castle as sacrifices for Nurvureem to user her breath weapon on. Once Nurvureem uses her breath weapon on these creatures, they rise as shadows under her controll.

## Legion of Bone

### Sofina (Red wizard and Necromancer Extrordinair)

Sofina is in service to her master **Szass Tam** a powerful archmage and the Zulkir of Necromancy.

Szass has sent Sofina to keep an eye on Neverwinter having learned that Mogrim and the rest of the Arcane Brotherhood have plans for the city.

Since Nurvureem took root in the Neverspire, Sofina has been waging a silent war against the drake in hopes that she can use it's powers to further her masters plans.

#### Motivations

Sofina seeks to control the castle so that her master can use it as a base of operations.

- Rid the castle of Nurvureem
- Claim the Scepter of Neverwinter to gain control over the Castle Guardians.

#### Minions

Sofina has a veritable army of undead at her disposal thanks to the Libram of Souls and Flesh left to her by her master

##### Deathlock Mastermind

The deathlock mastermind and its deathlocks are pacted to Szass but have been sworn in service to Sofina. Still the mastermind views Sofina as more of a rival than a master, and will turn on her the first chance it gets

##### Deathlocks

##### Skeletons

##### Zombies

#### Plan

Sofina plans to us the Libram of Souls and Flesh to cast Summon Undead at 9th level and have the creature aid her in a battle against Nurvureem.

## The Court of Lord Never

The spirits fo Lord Never and his court still roam the halls of Castle Never.

### Lord Halueth Never

Entrapped by the very swords put in place to guard against grave robbers, the spirit of Neverwinter's founding lord remains within the tomb of his corpse. From there he occasionally issues orders to his attendants and chief advisor Alfador

#### Motivation

Lord Never wishes freedom from his tomb and even more freedom for the spirits of his court. Should the players achieve this, Lord Never will bestow upon them the Crown of Neverwinter in thanks.

### The Neverwinter Nine

The spirits of the nine stand guard over lord Never. Though they have lost the ability to control their swords, and thus cannot free their liege, they are still willing to defend their lord till their last undying breath.

#### Talven

We shall not rest until his sword takes its rightful place.

#### Galavren

The only who remembers the promise left unfulfilled.

#### Floeshabel

#### Thracier (Absent)

#### Shoce

#### Coneth

#### N'halien

#### Tamper

#### Slade

## The Children of Origin

A sect of the children of origin seeks to turn the situation within Castle Never towards the destruction of Neverwinter. Equipped with a soul syphon, they plan to use its trapped power to suade either the eternal court or Nurvureem towards their destructive cause.

By the time the character's have entered Caste Never, the children of origin have already set up a base of operations theirin.

However the characters choose to handle the denizens of Castle Never, the Children of Origin will try to disrupt their plans.

### Desther

The servant of origin has been ordered to accompany the party into Castle Never and aid them in anyway he can.

Durring his time in their service, Desther will aid their quest in any way he can. However, Desther will feed his agents on the player's whereabouts and opetations within the Castle so that the Children of Origin can set up ambushes and disruptions.

## Other Noteable Denizens

### Large Luigi

This rather benevolent beholder once ruled the castle floors, until Nurvureem and The Necromancer arrived. Now, Large Luigi holds out in one of the collapsed towers, biding his time to escape. 

### The Axe of Unbridled Knowledge

The Axe of Unbridled Knowledge was brought into Castle Never by a Purple Dragon Knight named Sir Galvahad. The Axe lead him to Castle Never to warn it's denizens of the Castle's impending destruction. However, the duo was too late in warning the castle lord at the time. The subsequent destruction killed Sir Galvahad and burried the Axe of Unbridled knowledge with him.

When the shadow dragon eggs activated and began raising the spirits of the undead, The corpse of Sir Galvahad and his fellow kights were animated as well. The Axe hopes to leave the posession of Sir Galvahad's new form, finding this companion rather boring in his undead state. Doing so requires that the undead Sir Galvahad be defeated in battle, and the Axe's new owner attune to it.

### Old Man Bellows

The soul living inhabitant of Caste Never, Old Man Bellows is the last in a long line of grounds keepers. His survival in the haunted palace to this point is thanks to his lineage. The spirits of Castle Never can sense Bellow's connection to his ancestors and treat him as they did the previous grounds keepers.

Old Man Bellows knows the castle grounds better than anyone else. He can tell the players the best way to get from place to place, as well as what creatures they might encounter along the way. Should the party be willing to pay him handsomly, Bellows can even act as their guide through the castle.

Should the party take a liking to Bellows, either of the main factions within the castle might take him hostage. Nurvureem and the Children of Origin might take him hostage to gain leverage over the Never Court. While the Never Court might take him hostage to prevent said leverage. In either case, Old Man Bellows is treated with the utmost respect suring his captivity, as none of the groups are truly willing to risk the Courts wrath should something happen to him.

### Peter the Poltregeist

Peter was the court jester in service to Lord Never. Now that his lord is captured and Alfador prevents him from seeing his master, Peter prefers to torment the denizens of the castle whenever possible.

Should the party rescue lord Never, Peter will be forever greatful. However, Peter has no sense of planning, and cannot think to ask the party for this favor himself. The party might learn of his wants from speaking to other members of the Never Court abouyt the Poltregeist.

### Guardians of the Castle

Many of the suits of armor and weapons within Castle Never were enchanted to fend off intruders. But just like the swords protecting Lord Never, they cannot discern the identity of their spiritual masters. As such, these weapons and armor are prone to attack any beings they detect within Castle Never until someone takes their place as the rightful king of Castle Never. Doing this requires a person to sit upon the throne while wearing the Crown of Neverwinter and the Scepter of Neverwinter.

# Rooms of Note

## Castle Propper

### Atrium

During the height of the Alagondar family's rule, the castle boasted an open-air garden and aviary. It contained a lovely collection of flowers and other plants, as well as beautiful birds in ornate cages. Following the Ruining, the plants and birds alike were left to rot, and the atrium came to be overtaken by aggressive [myconids](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Myconid "Myconid") that spawned from the spores of something in the plant collection. By the late 15^th^ century DR, they had managed to completely seal the once open roof, leaving the garden dark and trapping the smell of rot and the blooms of [fungus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fungus "Fungus") inside.^[[9]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p151-9)^

### Great Hall

The castle's Great Hall was where the throne of the city's ruler was located. ^[[6]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NVN-6)^ ^[[13]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-DC-13)^ It was appointed in marble with a red carpet,^[[13]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-DC-13)^ and it contained ancient magical defenses that raised the alarm and sealed the gate if the castle came under attack.^[[6]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NVN-6)^

### Hall of Mirrors

This long corridor with a massive window on one end was adorned with full-length mirrors, ^[[9]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p151-9)^ ^[[10]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-N-10)^ and was used by the royal family to practice posture and appearance. However, this proved to be one of the most horrific places in the castle when Mount Hotenow erupted: first the mirrors shattered, slashing all occupants to pieces, just before searing volcanic gasses blasted through the window and incinerated the bodies. The spiritual wound this left on the victims caused the ash and glass in the room to animate and slowly reenact the event whenever a living being entered the room. During this time, it came to also be known as the  **Hall of Ashen Mirrors** .^[[9]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p151-9)^

### The Vault

The treasures of Castle Never and its occupants were stored in a secure vault known to be one of the most tightly secured locations on the [Sword Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Coast "Sword Coast"). Portcullises on the windows and an alarm that quickly mobilized the guards were meant to ensure that no thief who got near the vault would escape. As of the late 1490s DR,^[[note 1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-HAT-time-14)^ the door to the vault itself was protected by  *[Mordenkainen&#39;s arcane seal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mordenkainen%27s_arcane_seal "Mordenkainen's arcane seal")* .^[[11]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-HAT-11)^

## Neverneath

Also known as the "Endless Maze", Neverneath was the catacombs of Castle Never, containing a fortified dungeon ^[[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p148-2)^ ^[[14]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p152-15)^ and vast crypts,^[[15]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p104-16)^ including the tomb of Lord [Halueth Never](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halueth_Never "Halueth Never"). ^[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-SF.CnC-p16-1)^ ^[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-VGttN-p134-3)^ These catacombs were [magically](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Magic "Magic") protected to maintain the structural integrity of the building above, however the [Spellplague](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spellplague "Spellplague") altered the magic ward over time, increasing its power and giving it a malevolent sentience and the ability to reshape the corridors of Neverneath at will to confound and trap intruders. The corridors could circle back on themselves, forming infinite loops full of deadly traps and [gargoyles](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gargoyle "Gargoyle") that attacked anything that moved.^[[14]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p152-15)^ Deep within the bowels of the Neverneath were said to be connections to the [Shadowfell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowfell "Shadowfell")^[[10]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-N-10)^ and to the [Underdark](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Underdark "Underdark").^[[16]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-N:U-17)^

#### Tomb of Halueth Never

Somewhere deep in the castle was the final resting place of Lord [Halueth Never](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halueth_Never "Halueth Never"). His body lay upon a great stone slab and was protected by a ring of twelve gleaming, enchanted [swords](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword "Sword") that would animate and attack any intruder if they did not follow cryptic instructions written on the flagstones. ^[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-SF.CnC-p16-1)^ ^[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-VGttN-p134-3)^ He was also protected by enchanted statues of his most trusted servants, including those of the original Neverwinter Nine.^[[6]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NVN-6)^

#### Vault of the Nine

The [Neverwinter Nine](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Neverwinter_Nine "Neverwinter Nine"), nine elite bodyguards of Nasher Alagonadar and defenders of House Alagondar, were buried in a magically sealed crypt in the depths of the Neverneath. ^[[17]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p108-18)^ ^[[14]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p152-15)^ This area consisted of a circular chamber 200 feet (61 meters) across^[[14]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p152-15)^ and filled with  *[everburning torches](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Everburning_torch "Everburning torch")* , which surrounded an Inner Vault sealed with the sigil of Neverwinter and warded with powerful magic. Inside, the Inner Vault was carved with idyllic pictures of Summer illuminated by dim light radiating from nine [marble](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marble "Marble") coffins placed radially around a golden throne.^[[18]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p153-19)^

#### The Holes

As Castle Never was cleared and came back into use in the late 15^th^ century DR, a section beneath the ruins was dedicated as a prison for criminals sentenced to death for high crimes, including murder and treason (including tax evasion). This dungeon—which came to be known as the "holes"—was heavily guarded and held mass executions once each [tenday](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tenday "Tenday"), in which the condemned were publicly hanged. Prisoners were allowed a last meal delivered by friends and family on the day before their deaths, but otherwise anyone caught entering the holes was sentenced to imprisonment in them as well. The prison was only accessible through a single, heavily-guarded entrance located on the main level of the castle, although rumors persisted of a monster-infested secret tunnel that connected the holes to the shore of the [Blacklake](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Blacklake "Blacklake").^[[4]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-AI-p121-4)^
