The spirits fo Lord Never and his court still roam the halls of Castle Never.

In the absence of Lord Never, Alfador has become mad with power. He seeks to retain his power at all costs. Through deception and deceipt, Alfador has taken over the Never Court, claiming to only be passing on the orders of Lord Never, when in reality he simply clings to power. 

If prompted, Alfador will refuse to hand over the shadow eggs.

## The Children of Origin

A sect of the children of origin seeks to turn the situation within Castle Never towards the destruction of Neverwinter. Equipped with a soul syphon, they plan to use its trapped power to suade either the eternal court or Nurvureem towards their destructive cause.

By the time the character's have entered Caste Never, the children of origin have already set up a base of operations theirin. 

However the characters choose to handle the denizens of Castle Never, the Children of Origin will try to disrupt their plans. 

### Desther

The servant of origin has been ordered to accompany the party into Castle Never and aid them in anyway he can. 

Durring his time in their service, Desther will aid their quest in any way he can. However, Desther will feed his agents on the player's whereabouts and opetations within the Castle so that the Children of Origin can set up ambushes and disruptions. 

## Other Noteable Denizens

### Old Man Bellows

The soul living inhabitant of Caste Never, Old Man Bellows is the last in a long line of grounds keepers. His survival in the haunted palace to this point is thanks to his lineage. The spirits of Castle Never can sense Bellow's connection to his ancestors and treat him as they did the previous grounds keepers. 

Old Man Bellows knows the castle grounds better than anyone else. He can tell the players the best way to get from place to place, as well as what creatures they might encounter along the way. Should the party be willing to pay him handsomly, Bellows can even act as their guide through the castle. 

Should the party take a liking to Bellows, either of the main factions within the castle might take him hostage. Nurvureem and the Children of Origin might take him hostage to gain leverage over the Never Court. While the Never Court might take him hostage to prevent said leverage. In either case, Old Man Bellows is treated with the utmost respect suring his captivity, as none of the groups are truly willing to risk the Courts wrath should something happen to him. 

### Peter the Poltregeist

Peter was the court jester in service to Lord Never. Now that his lord is captured and Alfador prevents him from seeing his master, Peter prefers to torment the denizens of the castle whenever possible. 

Should the party rescue lord Never, Peter will be forever greatful. However, Peter has no sense of planning, and cannot think to ask the party for this favor himself. The party might learn of his wants from speaking to other members of the Never Court abouyt the Poltregeist. 

### Guardians of the Castle

Many of the suits of armor and weapons within Castle Never were enchanted to fend off intruders. But just like the swords protecting Lord Never, they cannot discern the identity of their spiritual masters. As such, these weapons and armor are prone to attack any beings they detect within Castle Never until someone takes their place as the rightful king of Castle Never. Doing this requires a person to sit upon the throne while wearing the Crown of Neverwinter and the Scepter of Neverwinter. 

### Spiders, Bats, and Rats oh my. 

# Rooms of Note

## Castle Propper

### Atrium

During the height of the Alagondar family's rule, the castle boasted an open-air garden and aviary. It contained a lovely collection of flowers and other plants, as well as beautiful birds in ornate cages. Following the Ruining, the plants and birds alike were left to rot, and the atrium came to be overtaken by aggressive [myconids](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Myconid "Myconid") that spawned from the spores of something in the plant collection. By the late 15^th^ century DR, they had managed to completely seal the once open roof, leaving the garden dark and trapping the smell of rot and the blooms of [fungus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fungus "Fungus") inside.^[[9]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p151-9)^

### Great Hall

The castle's Great Hall was where the throne of the city's ruler was located. ^[[6]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NVN-6)^ ^[[13]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-DC-13)^ It was appointed in marble with a red carpet,^[[13]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-DC-13)^ and it contained ancient magical defenses that raised the alarm and sealed the gate if the castle came under attack.^[[6]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NVN-6)^

### Hall of Mirrors

This long corridor with a massive window on one end was adorned with full-length mirrors, ^[[9]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p151-9)^ ^[[10]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-N-10)^ and was used by the royal family to practice posture and appearance. However, this proved to be one of the most horrific places in the castle when Mount Hotenow erupted: first the mirrors shattered, slashing all occupants to pieces, just before searing volcanic gasses blasted through the window and incinerated the bodies. The spiritual wound this left on the victims caused the ash and glass in the room to animate and slowly reenact the event whenever a living being entered the room. During this time, it came to also be known as the  **Hall of Ashen Mirrors** .^[[9]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p151-9)^

### The Vault

The treasures of Castle Never and its occupants were stored in a secure vault known to be one of the most tightly secured locations on the [Sword Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Coast "Sword Coast"). Portcullises on the windows and an alarm that quickly mobilized the guards were meant to ensure that no thief who got near the vault would escape. As of the late 1490s DR,^[[note 1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-HAT-time-14)^ the door to the vault itself was protected by  *[Mordenkainen&#39;s arcane seal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mordenkainen%27s_arcane_seal "Mordenkainen's arcane seal")* .^[[11]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-HAT-11)^

## Neverneath

Also known as the "Endless Maze", Neverneath was the catacombs of Castle Never, containing a fortified dungeon ^[[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p148-2)^ ^[[14]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p152-15)^ and vast crypts,^[[15]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p104-16)^ including the tomb of Lord [Halueth Never](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halueth_Never "Halueth Never"). ^[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-SF.CnC-p16-1)^ ^[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-VGttN-p134-3)^ These catacombs were [magically](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Magic "Magic") protected to maintain the structural integrity of the building above, however the [Spellplague](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spellplague "Spellplague") altered the magic ward over time, increasing its power and giving it a malevolent sentience and the ability to reshape the corridors of Neverneath at will to confound and trap intruders. The corridors could circle back on themselves, forming infinite loops full of deadly traps and [gargoyles](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gargoyle "Gargoyle") that attacked anything that moved.^[[14]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p152-15)^ Deep within the bowels of the Neverneath were said to be connections to the [Shadowfell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowfell "Shadowfell")^[[10]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-N-10)^ and to the [Underdark](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Underdark "Underdark").^[[16]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-N:U-17)^

#### Tomb of Halueth Never

Somewhere deep in the castle was the final resting place of Lord [Halueth Never](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halueth_Never "Halueth Never"). His body lay upon a great stone slab and was protected by a ring of twelve gleaming, enchanted [swords](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword "Sword") that would animate and attack any intruder if they did not follow cryptic instructions written on the flagstones. ^[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-SF.CnC-p16-1)^ ^[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-VGttN-p134-3)^ He was also protected by enchanted statues of his most trusted servants, including those of the original Neverwinter Nine.^[[6]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NVN-6)^

#### Vault of the Nine

The [Neverwinter Nine](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Neverwinter_Nine "Neverwinter Nine"), nine elite bodyguards of Nasher Alagonadar and defenders of House Alagondar, were buried in a magically sealed crypt in the depths of the Neverneath. ^[[17]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p108-18)^ ^[[14]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p152-15)^ This area consisted of a circular chamber 200 feet (61 meters) across^[[14]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p152-15)^ and filled with  *[everburning torches](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Everburning_torch "Everburning torch")* , which surrounded an Inner Vault sealed with the sigil of Neverwinter and warded with powerful magic. Inside, the Inner Vault was carved with idyllic pictures of Summer illuminated by dim light radiating from nine [marble](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marble "Marble") coffins placed radially around a golden throne.^[[18]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-NCS-p153-19)^

#### The Holes

As Castle Never was cleared and came back into use in the late 15^th^ century DR, a section beneath the ruins was dedicated as a prison for criminals sentenced to death for high crimes, including murder and treason (including tax evasion). This dungeon—which came to be known as the "holes"—was heavily guarded and held mass executions once each [tenday](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tenday "Tenday"), in which the condemned were publicly hanged. Prisoners were allowed a last meal delivered by friends and family on the day before their deaths, but otherwise anyone caught entering the holes was sentenced to imprisonment in them as well. The prison was only accessible through a single, heavily-guarded entrance located on the main level of the castle, although rumors persisted of a monster-infested secret tunnel that connected the holes to the shore of the [Blacklake](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Blacklake "Blacklake").^[[4]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Never#cite_note-AI-p121-4)^
